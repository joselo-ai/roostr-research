**Subject:** Quick question re: signal validation

**Message:**
```
Hey [Name],

Saw your thread on [specific topic they posted about] — sharp take.

Quick context: Building the first AI-native hedge fund (roostr). We're deploying $100k paper capital using multi-agent system (Scout, Atlas, Quant).

Looking for a quant advisor to review signal quality + validate our statistical tests quarterly. 4-6 hours, 0.5-1% equity.

Would this interest you? Happy to share our conviction docs + GitHub repo upfront.

## DM Template B: Peer Collaboration

**Subject:** AI hedge fund + need quant brain

**Message:**
```
[Name],

Respect your work at [Company]. Following the AI-native hedge fund playbook (YC Spring 2026 RFS).

Built 3 AI agents (signal discovery, validation, risk). Deployed first trades this week. Full transparency on GitHub.

Need someone with real quant chops to stress-test our methodology. Not looking to hire — thinking quarterly advisor (0.5-1% equity for reviews).

Interested in seeing what we're building?

— G
```

## DM Template C: Problem-Specific

**Subject:** Backtest overfitting question

**Message:**
```
[Name] —

Quick one: How do you handle overfitting when backtesting low-frequency strategies (1-2 trades/month)?

Context: We're using walk-forward validation but sample size is small. Wondering if there's a better approach.

Also — if this kind of problem interests you, we're looking for a quant advisor (quarterly reviews, 0.5-1% equity). Building AI hedge fund, happy to show what we've built.

Either way, curious about your take on the overfitting thing.

## DM Template D: Research-First

**Subject:** Loved your paper on [topic]

**Message:**
```
[Name],

Read your [paper title] — the [specific insight] completely changed how I think about [topic].

Building roostr (AI-native hedge fund). We're tackling similar problems: multi-source signal validation, statistical rigor, risk controls.

Would love to get your eyes on our research docs (conviction-driven, 10-20 pages each). If the work resonates, interested in quarterly advisor role? 0.5-1% equity, minimal time commitment.

## DM Template E: Community Value-Add

**Subject:** roostr + AI quant research

**Message:**
```
Hey [Name],

Appreciate your contributions to [community/forum they're active in].

We're building roostr — first AI-native hedge fund. Multi-agent architecture, full transparency (GitHub), deploying capital live.

Looking for quant advisors who can:
- Review signal validation methodology
- Stress-test backtests
- Challenge assumptions

Quarterly commitment (4-6h), 0.5-1% equity. Less "here's what to do" and more "here's what you're missing."

Want to see what we're building?
