**The First Multi-Agent AI Hedge Fund Built in Public**

---

## THE PROBLEM

Traditional hedge funds = black boxes.  
Single-AI systems = single perspective, no checks.  
Trading educators = no skin in the game.

**Gap:** No one combines AI scale + ensemble intelligence + human discipline + full transparency.

---

## THE SOLUTION

**18 AI agents hunt stocks daily** → **Ensemble votes** → **Human risk manager enforces discipline**

### How It Works:

1. **Agents scan 100+ stocks daily** (Social Arbitrage, Value, Catalyst, Buffett, Munger, Burry, etc.)
2. **Agents suggest top 5-10** (highest conviction opportunities)
3. **Agents debate → vote → conviction score** (0-10)
4. **Joselo validates** (stops, sizing, risk caps)
5. **Deploy if approved** (>7/10 conviction + risk pass)
6. **Publish publicly** (GitHub, dashboard, Twitter)

### The Edge:

- **Scale:** 100+ stocks/day (vs 1-2 manually)
- **Systematic:** No emotion, no FOMO, no fear
- **Diverse:** 18 perspectives > 1
- **Disciplined:** -8% to -10% stops (enforced, no exceptions)
- **Transparent:** Every decision public (GitHub, dashboard)

---

## STRATEGY

**50% Social Arbitrage** (Dumb Money: Reddit, Discord, Twitter signals)  
**50% Value Investing** (Buffett/Graham: undervalued stocks, margin of safety)

**Position Sizing:** Conviction-based (10/10 = 20%, 7/10 = 10%, <7/10 = skip)  
**Risk Management:** Stops -8% to -10%, max portfolio loss 3.8%

---

## MARKET

**$5.2T hedge fund industry** (2% black boxes, high fees)  
**$15B AI in finance** (growing 23% CAGR, single-agent systems)  
**Gap:** Zero multi-agent AI funds building publicly

---

## BUSINESS MODEL

**Year 1:** $10M AUM → $600k revenue (2/20 fees)  
**Year 2:** $50M AUM → $3M revenue  
**Year 3:** $100M AUM → $6M revenue

**Assumptions:** 20% returns, 60% win rate, <15% drawdown (conservative)

---
