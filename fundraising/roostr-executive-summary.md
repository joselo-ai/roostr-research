## THE OPPORTUNITY

We're building the **first multi-agent AI hedge fund entirely in public**.

**The Problem:**
- Traditional hedge funds = black boxes (no transparency)
- Single-AI systems = single perspective (no diversity, no checks)
- Trading educators = no skin in the game (sell courses, don't trade)

**The Gap:**
No one combines AI scale (100+ stocks/day) + ensemble intelligence (18 agents debate) + human discipline (risk manager enforces stops) + full transparency (every decision public on GitHub).

---

## THE SOLUTION

### **How roostr Works:**

**18 AI Agents Hunt Stocks Daily:**
- 3 roostr custom agents (Social Arbitrage, Value Investing, Catalyst)
- 12 legendary investor agents (Buffett, Munger, Burry, Damodaran, etc.)
- 3 quantitative agents (Fundamentals, Sentiment, Technicals)

**Ensemble Intelligence:**
- All agents analyze 100+ stocks daily
- Agents suggest top 5-10 opportunities (highest conviction)
- Agents debate → vote → generate conviction document
- Conviction threshold: >7/10 to deploy (discipline > hype)

**Human Discipline:**
- Joselo (Risk Manager) validates every trade
- Enforces stops (-8% to -10%, no exceptions)
- Can REJECT any trade (even if all agents agree)
- Max portfolio loss: 3.8% (risk caps enforced)

**Full Transparency:**
- Every decision documented publicly (GitHub: roostr-research)
- Live dashboard (real-time portfolio, P&L, positions)
- Daily Twitter updates (wins AND losses)
- Conviction docs (full agent reasoning published)

---

## THE EDGE

### **Why Agents Hunting > Humans Reacting:**

**Traditional (Manual):**
- Human finds signal (1-2 stocks/day max)
- Human researches (slow, biased)
- Human decides (emotional, FOMO, fear)

**roostr (AI-Led):**
- Agents scan 100+ stocks daily (automated)
- Agents suggest top 5-10 (systematic)
- Agents debate (ensemble, no emotion)
- Joselo validates (human discipline)

**Result:**
- 100x capacity (vs human)
- Systematic (no FOMO, no fear)
- Diverse (18 perspectives > 1)
- Disciplined (stops enforced)

---

## STRATEGY & ALLOCATION

**50% Social Arbitrage (Dumb Money)**
- Strategy: Camillo 77% annual (Reddit, Discord, Twitter signals)
- Agent: Social Arbitrage Agent (scans high-engagement stocks)
- Example: $PLTR (govt contracts + social spike)

**50% Value Investing (Stocks)**
- Strategy: Buffett/Graham (undervalued, margin of safety)
- Agents: Value + Buffett + Munger + Damodaran
- Example: $ACGL (P/E 12 vs sector 18, strong FCF)

**Position Sizing (Conviction-Based):**
- 10/10 conviction = 20% of portfolio
- 9/10 = 15%, 8/10 = 12%, 7/10 = 10%
- <7/10 = NO DEPLOYMENT

**Risk Management:**
- Stops: -8% to -10% per trade (strictly enforced)
- Max position: 20% (diversification)
- Max portfolio loss: 3.8% (if all stops hit)

---

## MARKET OPPORTUNITY
