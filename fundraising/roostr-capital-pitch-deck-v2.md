## SLIDE 2: THE VISION

**Title:** "What If 18 Legendary Investors + AI Analyzed Every Stock... Every Day?"

**Content:**

**The Idea:**

Instead of one analyst (slow, limited capacity)...  
Instead of one AI (single perspective, black box)...

**What if:**
- 18 AI agents analyzed 100+ stocks daily
- Each agent = different investment philosophy (Buffett, Munger, Burry, social arbitrage, catalysts)
- Agents debate → ensemble votes → human risk manager approves
- Every decision documented publicly (full transparency)

**That's roostr Capital.**

We're building the first multi-agent AI hedge fund entirely in public.

**The Result:**
- Systematic edge (AI scale + human discipline)
- Full transparency (GitHub, dashboard, conviction docs)
- Proven track record (built publicly for 12+ months before launching fund)

**Visual:** Diagram showing 18 agents → ensemble vote → human override → deploy

## SLIDE 3: THE PROBLEM

**Title:** "The Trading Industry Has Three Fatal Flaws"

**Content:**

### **Traditional Hedge Funds:**
- ❌ Black boxes (you can't see why they trade)
- ❌ High fees (2/20 standard, no transparency)
- ❌ No proof (you invest blind, hope they're good)

### **Trading Educators:**
- ❌ Hype-driven (sell dreams, not systems)
- ❌ No skin in the game (sell courses, don't trade)
- ❌ Cherry-picked wins (losses hidden)

### **Single-AI Systems:**
- ❌ Single perspective (no diversity of thought)
- ❌ Black box decisions (can't explain reasoning)
- ❌ Hallucination risk (overconfidence, no checks)

### **The Gap:**

**No one combines:**
1. AI scale (analyze 100+ stocks/day)
2. Ensemble intelligence (18 perspectives debate)
3. Human discipline (risk manager enforces stops)
4. Full transparency (every decision public)

**Visual:** Three-column comparison showing flaws

## SLIDE 4: THE SOLUTION

**Title:** "roostr — 18 Agents Hunt. Ensemble Votes. Humans Enforce Discipline."

**Content:**

### **How It Works:**

```
Daily Market Scan (100+ stocks analyzed)
    ↓
18 AI Agents Suggest Stocks
    ├→ Social Arbitrage Agent (Dumb Money signals)
    ├→ Value Investing Agent (undervalued stocks)
    ├→ Catalyst Agent (earnings, FDA, events)
    ├→ Buffett Agent (wonderful companies, fair prices)
    ├→ Munger Agent (quality businesses)
    ├→ Burry Agent (deep value, contrarian)
    ├→ Peter Lynch Agent (ten-baggers)
    ├→ Damodaran Agent (valuation)
    ├→ Fundamentals Agent (financials, ratios)
    ├→ Sentiment Agent (market sentiment)
    ├→ Technicals Agent (RSI, moving averages)
    └→ (+ 7 more legendary investor agents)
    ↓
Ensemble Vote (all agents debate)
    ├→ Conviction score: 0-10 (averaged)
    ├→ Each agent documents reasoning
    └→ Disagreements noted (diversity = strength)
    ↓
Generate Conviction Document
    ├→ What stock? Why?
    ├→ What's the edge? (what agents saw)
    ├→ What's the risk? (downside scenarios)
    └→ Conviction score: X/10
    ↓
Joselo Risk Agent (Human Override)
    ├→ Validates stop-loss (-8% to -10%)
    ├→ Validates position sizing (conviction × capital)
    ├→ Checks max portfolio loss (<3.8%)
    └→ APPROVE or REJECT
    ↓
Deploy (if APPROVED)
    ├→ Execute trade
    ├→ Publish conviction doc (GitHub)
    ├→ Update dashboard (public, real-time)
    └→ Tweet (full transparency)
```

**Key Differentiator:**

Agents don't just analyze signals from humans.  
**Agents HUNT stocks proactively.**

They scan the market daily, suggest top opportunities, debate, and vote.

## SLIDE 5: THE AGENTS (What Makes Them Different)

**Title:** "18 Agents = 3 Custom + 12 Legendary + 3 Quant"

**Content:**

### **roostr Custom Agents (Built by Us):**

**1. Social Arbitrage Agent**
- Philosophy: Camillo 77% annual strategy (Dumb Money)
- Sources: Reddit (wallstreetbets, stocks), Discord, Twitter
- Output: Stocks with high social engagement + fundamental backing
- Example: "$PLTR trending 1250↑ on r/stocks (govt contracts catalyst)"

**2. Value Investing Agent**
- Philosophy: Buffett/Graham (wonderful companies, fair prices)
- Sources: Stock screeners (low P/E, high FCF, strong balance sheets)
- Output: Undervalued stocks with margin of safety
- Example: "$ACGL undervalued (P/E 12 vs sector 18, strong FCF)"

**3. Catalyst Agent**
- Philosophy: Events drive price (earnings, FDA, product launches)
- Sources: Earnings calendar, FDA tracker, M&A news
- Output: Stocks with near-term catalysts
- Example: "$ASTS FCC approval imminent (binary event)"

### **Legendary Investor Agents (virattt Framework):**

- **Buffett:** Wonderful companies at fair prices
- **Munger:** Quality businesses only
- **Burry:** Deep value, contrarian
- **Graham:** Hidden gems, margin of safety
- **Pabrai:** Doubles at low risk
- **Lynch:** Ten-baggers in everyday businesses
- **Cathie Wood:** Innovation and disruption
- **Ackman:** Bold activist positions
- **Druckenmiller:** Asymmetric opportunities
- **Damodaran:** Story, numbers, valuation
- **Phil Fisher:** Deep scuttlebutt research
- **Jhunjhunwala:** Big Bull of India

### **Quantitative Agents:**

- **Fundamentals Agent:** Financials, ratios, balance sheet health
- **Sentiment Agent:** Market sentiment, fear/greed index
- **Technicals Agent:** RSI, moving averages, support/resistance

### **Risk Manager (Human):**

- **Joselo 🐓:** Enforces stops, validates sizing, can REJECT any trade

**Why This Matters:**

Ensemble intelligence > single perspective.  
Diversity of thought = better decisions.  
Human oversight = discipline when AI gets overconfident.

## SLIDE 6: WHY AGENTS HUNTING > HUMANS REACTING

**Title:** "The Edge: Proactive AI vs Reactive Humans"

**Content:**

### **Traditional Approach (Manual):**

1. Human finds signal (Twitter, Discord, news)
2. Human researches (slow, 1-2 stocks/day max)
3. Human decides (biased, emotional, limited capacity)
4. Human deploys (maybe)

**Problems:**
- Slow (can't analyze 100 stocks/day)
- Biased (confirmation bias, FOMO, fear)
- Limited (miss 99% of opportunities)

### **roostr Approach (AI-Led):**

1. **Agents scan 100+ stocks daily** (automated)
2. **Agents suggest top 5-10** (highest conviction)
3. **Agents debate** (ensemble intelligence)
4. **Joselo validates** (human risk check)
5. **Deploy if approved** (>7/10 conviction + risk pass)

**Advantages:**
- Scale (100x capacity vs human)
- Systematic (no emotion, no FOMO)
- Diverse (18 perspectives, not 1)
- Disciplined (human enforces stops)

### **Real Example (How It Would Work):**

**Monday Morning Scan:**

Agents analyze 100 stocks.

**Social Arbitrage Agent reports:**
- "$PLTR trending (1250↑ reddit, govt contracts)"
- Conviction: 8/10

**Value Agent reports:**
- "$ACGL undervalued (P/E 12 vs 18 sector, FCF strong)"
- Conviction: 9/10

**Buffett Agent debates:**
- "$PLTR not a wonderful business (unprofitable, speculative)"
- Conviction: 5/10

**Munger Agent debates:**
- "$ACGL quality business, fair price. Yes."
- Conviction: 9/10

**Ensemble Decision:**

**$ACGL:** 8.5/10 avg conviction → BUY (agents agree)  
**$PLTR:** 6.5/10 avg conviction → WATCH (not enough conviction)

**Joselo validates $ACGL:**
- Position size: 15% (conviction-based)
- Stop: -8%
- Max loss: 1.2% portfolio
- **APPROVED**

**Result:** Deploy $ACGL, skip $PLTR (discipline > hype)

**Visual:** Side-by-side comparison (manual vs AI-led)

## SLIDE 16: RISKS & MITIGATIONS

**Title:** "How We Manage Risk"

**Content:**

### **Market Risk:**

**Risk:** Bear markets, volatility spikes, drawdowns

**Mitigation:**
- Strict stops (-8% to -10% per trade)
- Max portfolio loss: 3.8% (if all stops hit)
- Diversification (social arbitrage + value investing)
- Human override (Joselo can pause all trading)

### **AI Risk:**

**Risk:** Model hallucinations, overconfidence, bad recommendations

**Mitigation:**
- Ensemble voting (18 agents debate, not 1)
- Human risk manager (Joselo can reject any trade)
- Conviction threshold (>7/10 required to deploy)
- Backtesting validation (test on historical data first)

### **Regulatory Risk:**

**Risk:** SEC scrutiny, compliance violations

**Mitigation:**
- SEC registration from Month 10 (before taking investor capital)
- Legal counsel on retainer (securities lawyer)
- No investment advice (educational only until fund launches)
- Full transparency (public GitHub, all decisions documented)

### **Execution Risk:**

**Risk:** Slippage, liquidity issues, can't execute at expected prices

**Mitigation:**
- Focus on liquid stocks (S&P 500, high-volume names)
- Limit orders (not market orders)
- Position sizing caps (max 20% per position)

### **Team Risk:**

**Risk:** Key person dependency (G or Joselo leaves)

**Mitigation:**
- Document everything (systems > individuals)
- Hire redundancy (Head of AI can run agents)
- Open-source foundation (virattt framework, community support)

### **Reputation Risk:**

**Risk:** Public losses damage brand, investor confidence drops

**Mitigation:**
- Full transparency (document wins AND losses)
- Focus on process over results (discipline > short-term PnL)
- Risk-first messaging ("We're not perfect, we're disciplined")

**Visual:** Risk matrix (probability vs impact) with mitigations

## SLIDE 17: WHY NOW?

**Title:** "The AI Trading Revolution is Here — We're the First to Build in Public"

**Content:**

### **Market Timing:**

**1. AI in Finance is Exploding**
- ChatGPT moment for trading (everyone sees the potential)
- But: No one building multi-agent AI funds transparently
- Gap: We're first-movers

**2. Transparency Demand Growing**
- Retail investors distrust black-box funds
- Want to see reasoning (not just results)
- roostr = only fund showing all decisions publicly

**3. Multi-Agent Systems Proven**
- virattt's repo: 45.7k GitHub stars (validated demand)
- Research shows ensemble AI > single AI
- We're productizing proven tech

**4. Team Ready**
- G (strategist) + Joselo (operator) = proven duo
- Infrastructure live (dashboard, automation, GitHub)
- Track record started (TAO, SOL positions public)

**5. Audience Building**
- Twitter: @roostrcapital (growing daily)
- GitHub: roostr-research (all code public)
- Dashboard: Live portfolio, transparent P&L

### **Why roostr Wins:**

✅ **First-mover:** Only public multi-agent AI hedge fund  
✅ **Technical moat:** 18-agent system (hard to replicate)  
✅ **Trust:** Built publicly (12 months before asking for capital)  
✅ **Community:** Audience = investor pipeline (warm leads only)

### **The Competition:**

**Traditional hedge funds:**
- Black boxes (losing trust)
- Can't compete with AI scale

**Single-AI funds:**
- No transparency
- Single perspective (no ensemble)

**Trading educators:**
- No skin in the game
- Sell dreams, not systems

**roostr:**
- Multi-agent AI (ensemble intelligence)
- Full transparency (GitHub, dashboard)
- Human discipline (risk manager enforces stops)
- Proven publicly (before asking for capital)
