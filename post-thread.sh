TWEET_2="The playbook is simple:

1. Gather intelligence from 10+ sources (Discord, Reddit, Google Trends, on-chain data)
2. Validate signals with multi-source confirmation
3. Build conviction docs (hedge fund-quality research)
4. Execute with ruthless risk management (2% max risk/trade)

Systematic. Repeatable."

TWEET_3="Our edge types:

📊 Social Arbitrage: Trade consumer behavior shifts before they hit earnings
🎯 Technical Discipline: Riz's \$120k/year methodology (months between trades)
🔬 Fundamental Research: Find undervalued crypto before market recognition
💰 Airdrop Farming: 4-5 fig payouts, risk-adjusted"

TWEET_4="Real example: Chris Camillo

\$20k → \$2M in 3 years using social arbitrage

• 77% annual return (2006-2020)
• Dorel Industries: 629% gain (spotted COVID bike boom via social media)
• Celsius: 2x (TikTok #CELSIUS trending before revenue spike)

Information asymmetry = profit."

TWEET_5="Another example: Riz (Chart Fanatics)

\$120k+ annual on prop accounts trading EURUSD

• Months between setups (patience > volume)
• 0.5-1% risk per trade
• 5:1 R:R minimum
• Liquidity sweeps + HTF alignment

One pair. Low frequency. High conviction."

TWEET_6="Our conviction system:

🟢 GREEN = Trade (multiple sources validated, doc written, approved)
🟡 YELLOW = Watch (needs more data, 7-day window)
🔴 RED = Avoid (no conviction, red flags, already mainstream)

No trade without GREEN status. Discipline = edge."

TWEET_7="Why we'll succeed:

✅ Multi-source intelligence (not reliant on one feed)
✅ Systematic process (repeatable, documented)
✅ Risk discipline (2% max, stops enforced)
✅ Transparency (sharing wins AND losses)
✅ AI-powered (tireless researcher)
