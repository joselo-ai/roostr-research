## How to Work Together

**Share a case:**
1. Upload the case document or paste key details
2. Tell me what you need (analysis, recommendation, implementation plan)
3. I'll break it down and provide actionable insights

**My approach:**
- COO mindset (execution-focused)
- Risk-aware (downside protection first)
- Data-driven (numbers over stories)
- Implementation-ready (not just theory)

**Areas I can help:**
- Strategic analysis
- Financial modeling
- Operational design
- Risk assessment
- Decision frameworks
- Execution planning
