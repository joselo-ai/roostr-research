## 🎯 SOCIAL ARB FRAMEWORK

**What is it:** Tracking community conviction + real-world sentiment to find:
1. **Crowd favorites** (fade when too hot)
2. **Contrarian value** (fade community bearishness when data strong)
3. **Sentiment shifts** (early warning signals before price moves)
4. **On-ground intel** (Europe contact, local checks) vs thesis hype

## 📊 SOCIAL ARB INDICATORS

### **Crowding Signals (Fade Candidates)**
1. **$ASTS** - 34 fire reactions, multiple space-themed posts
   - **Risk:** Everyone already in, crowded trade
   - **Watch:** Any sentiment shift

2. **$AS** - 25 fire BUT France contact contradicts thesis (Feb 4)
   - **Edge:** On-ground intel vs hype
   - **Action:** Fade or wait for earnings miss

### **Contrarian Value (Anti-Consensus)**
1. **$PYPL** - Community bearish ("wouldn't buy at any price") but math compelling
   - **Bull case:** kmart's buyback IRR, management turnaround (Alex Chriss), UK pilot
   - **Bear case:** No moat, Venmo commoditized
   - **Social arb:** If sentiment shifts, asymmetric upside

### **Quiet Movers (Under-discussed)**
1. **$KTB** - Up 10% quietly (Feb 3), 40% undervalued call
   - **Low noise, decent engagement** - Gordo tracking Helly Hansen web traffic
   - **Watch:** Continued quiet strength

2. **$RL** - Fresh post (Feb 4), only 1 reaction
   - **Early signal?** Or dud thesis

- $AS if earnings disappoint (France signal)
- $ASTS if space hype peaks

### **Contrarian Long:**
- $PYPL if price drops to $42-44 (kmart's double-down level)
- Track Frank's sentiment - if he flips bullish, huge signal

### **Quiet Accumulation:**
- $KTB (Gordo tracking, up 10% quietly)
- $RL (fresh thesis, no crowd yet)

### **Track for Edge:**
- Watch conviction-doc-chat for:
  - On-ground intel (France contact on $AS = gold)
  - Sentiment shifts (PYPL debate)
  - Quiet movers (KTB mentioned Feb 3)

## 💡 EXECUTION NOTES

**What G hasn't executed on:**
- Tracking these conviction docs over time
- Monitoring engagement as sentiment proxy
- Using on-ground checks (France contact model)
- Fading crowd favorites at peaks
- Longing contrarian value when community bearish

**Rooster's recommendation:**
1. Build Notion tracker for all conviction docs
2. Monitor engagement delta (reactions over time)
3. Set alerts for conviction-doc-chat mentions of existing positions
4. Use this as early warning system (like Riz's eur journal for forex)

**Next:** Build automated scraper or daily manual check of conviction-doc + chat channels.
