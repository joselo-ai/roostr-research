## Design Tips for Google Slides

1. **Use slide templates:** Create 3-4 master slides (title, two-column, centered, table)
2. **Icons:** Use simple line icons from Noun Project or Flaticon
3. **Charts:** Keep them clean (no 3D, minimal colors)
4. **Whitespace:** Don't overcrowd slides — one key message per slide
5. **Animations:** Minimal (fade in only, no bouncing)
6. **Fonts:** Stick to 2 fonts max (heading + body)
7. **Colors:** Black/white/green only (roostr brand)
8. **Consistency:** Same layout style throughout

**Export settings:**
- PDF for distribution
- Google Slides link for live updates
- PowerPoint (.pptx) for compatibility
