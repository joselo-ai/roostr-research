## 📈 ROI ESTIMATES

### Conservative Estimate (Assumes 1 good trade per week from new signals)

**Scenario: You're trading with $10k account**
- Good trade = 5% gain = $500/week = $2000/month
- Cost of Optimal plan: $343/mo
- **Net gain: $1,657/mo**
- **ROI: 483%**

**Scenario: You're trading with $50k account**
- Good trade = 3% gain = $1500/week = $6000/month
- Cost of Comprehensive plan: $787/mo
- **Net gain: $5,213/mo**
- **ROI: 662%**

### Realistic Estimate (Assumes signals improve win rate by 10%)

**Current:** 50% win rate, 10 trades/week
- Wins: 5 trades @ +5% = +25%
- Losses: 5 trades @ -3% = -15%
- Net: +10% per week = +40% per month

**With new signals:** 60% win rate, 10 trades/week
- Wins: 6 trades @ +5% = +30%
- Losses: 4 trades @ -3% = -12%
- Net: +18% per week = +72% per month

**Improvement:** +32% per month from signal quality

On $10k account: $3,200/mo improvement - $343 cost = **$2,857/mo net gain**  
On $50k account: $16,000/mo improvement - $787 cost = **$15,213/mo net gain**

## ⚠️ COST TRAPS TO AVOID

### ❌ Don't Do This:
1. **Glassnode Professional ($799/mo)** - Too expensive for marginal improvement over free/cheaper on-chain sources
2. **Apptopia ($10k+/yr)** - Enterprise pricing, unproven ROI for trading signals
3. **Subscribing to all 30 sources at once** - Signal overload, can't evaluate what works

### ✅ Do This Instead:
1. Start with free sources (Tier 1)
2. Add highest-ROI paid source (Unusual Whales $45/mo)
3. Validate for 2-4 weeks
4. Gradually add more paid sources
5. Cut underperformers ruthlessly
