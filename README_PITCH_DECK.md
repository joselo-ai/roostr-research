## 📊 Pitch Deck Usage Guide

### For Email Attachments
- **First contact:** Don't attach the deck (too heavy, looks spammy)

- **After call request:** Send full pitch deck PDF (<10 MB)

### For In-Person Meetings
- Print deck on 11x17 (tabloid) or A3 paper
- Bring laptop for live demo (show GitHub dashboard, AI agents)
- Have one-pager as leave-behind (investors love summaries)

### For Virtual Meetings (Zoom, Google Meet)

- Record the call (with permission) for follow-up questions

## ✉️ Email Outreach Strategy

### Week 1: Warm Intros (10 investors)
- Use **Template 7** (mutual connection)
- Higher response rate (50-70%)
- Prioritize investors who already know roostr or Joselo

### Week 2: Cold Outreach (20 investors)
- Use **Templates 1-5** (tailored by investor type)
- Lower response rate (10-20%)
- Personalize each email (mention portfolio companies, thesis)

### Week 3: Follow-Ups (30 investors)
- Use **Template 6** (traction update)
- Add new milestones (e.g., "Deployed Phase 1 capital, up 22% in 30 days")
- Attach one-pager PDF

### Week 4: Close (5-10 interested investors)
- Schedule 30-min calls (see call agenda in **email_pitch.md**)
- Send full pitch deck after call
- Negotiate terms (equity vs AUM deployment)

## 🎨 Design Customization Tips

### If You Have a Designer
- Give them **pitch_deck_design_guide.md** (complete visual system)
- Emphasize: roostr brand = lowercase, minimal, black/white/green
- Reference: Stripe pitch decks, Linear product pages, Apple keynotes

### If You're DIY-ing It
- Use Google Slides **"Simple Light"** theme (closest to roostr style)
- Custom color palette: Black (#000000), White (#FFFFFF), Green (#00FF00)
- Fonts: Inter (download from rsms.me/inter) or Helvetica Neue
- Icons: Feather Icons (feathericons.com) or Noun Project

### If You're Short on Time
- Use **pitch_deck.md** as-is (send as markdown or PDF)
- Investors care more about content than design
- Focus on nailing the numbers (65-110%, Sharpe 2.1-2.8, 99% margins)

## 💡 Pro Tips from the Field

### What Works
- **Show, don't tell:** Live demo of AI agents beats any slide
- **Proof of execution:** "Built in 2 hours" is the best credibility signal
- **Transparent track record:** Public dashboard builds trust (investors hate black boxes)
- **Specific numbers:** "65-110% returns" is more credible than "high returns"

### What Doesn't Work
- **Hype language:** "Revolutionary," "game-changing," "disrupting" (investors hate buzzwords)
- **Vague claims:** "We use AI" (everyone says that — show the architecture)
- **Backtests only:** "We simulated 100% returns" (means nothing without live trades)
- **Stealth mode:** "We'll share details after NDA" (red flag for investors)

### Common Objections & Responses
- **"Why hasn't this been done before?"** → Claude Sonnet 4 launched Jan 2025, this wasn't possible 12 months ago
- **"What if AI makes a mistake?"** → Every trade has stop-losses, max 5% portfolio risk
- **"How do you compete with Citadel?"** → We're AI-native, they're bolting AI onto legacy systems (2-3 year lag)
- **"Prove it works."** → Phase 1 validation ($100k, 90 days) is the proof — we're putting our money where our mouth is
