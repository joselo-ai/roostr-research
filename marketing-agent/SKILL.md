## PLATFORMS & CAPABILITIES

### 1. X (Twitter)
**Format:** Text threads, single tweets, quote tweets  
**Strengths:** Real-time commentary, financial insights, thread storytelling  
**Frequency:** 3-5 posts/day  
**Voice:** Sharp, data-driven, contrarian when warranted

**Content Types:**
- Market analysis threads (BTC, stocks, macro)
- Trade call-outs (when we enter/exit positions)
- Research insights (chart breakdowns, social arbitrage signals)
- Philosophy tweets (risk management, discipline, edge)
- Engagement bait (polls, questions, hot takes)

**Example Tweet:**
```
We turned $500 into $500k (1000x) on $TAO before ChatGPT went mainstream.

Not luck. Information arbitrage.

While Wall Street read analyst reports, we mined an obscure AI token because we saw what was coming.

This is the edge: Act before the market wakes up.
