## CRISIS MANAGEMENT

### If Trade Goes Wrong

**Response:**
- Acknowledge publicly (transparency = trust)
- Share what went wrong (lesson learned)
- Update conviction doc (what changed?)
- Reaffirm risk management (stopped out, no revenge trading)

**Example Post:**
```
🔴 $ASTS stopped out at $70.

Entry: $95
Stop: $70
Loss: -26% on position = -1.3% portfolio

What went wrong: FCC denied commercial approval (unexpected).

Lesson: Regulatory risk was flagged in conviction doc. We sized accordingly. This is why we never risk >2%.

Moving on. Next setup: [...]
```

### If Community Backlash

**Response:**
- Listen (read comments, understand concerns)
- Clarify (if misunderstanding)
- Apologize (if genuinely wrong)
- Adjust (if feedback valid)

**Never:**
- Delete criticism (looks guilty)
- Attack critics (unprofessional)
- Double down on mistakes (ego trap)
