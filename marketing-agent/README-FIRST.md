## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Do I need to write posts?**  
A: No. System auto-generates from signals.

**Q: What if I miss the API setup?**  
A: Manual posts still work. Queue tells you what to post.

**Q: How do I know it's working?**  
A: Check `~/.openclaw/logs/marketing/post.log`

**Q: Can I customize the posts?**  
A: Yes. Edit templates in `automation/generate_content.py`

**Q: What about Instagram?**  
A: Start with X only. Instagram is optional (manual from queue works).
