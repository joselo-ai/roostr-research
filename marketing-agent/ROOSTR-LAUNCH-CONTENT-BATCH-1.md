```
🐓 Introducing ROOSTR

The first AI hedge fund platform.

We hunt information asymmetries across stocks, crypto, and forex—
before the market wakes up.

Built in public. Transparent. Systematic.

This is the future of retail investing.

🧵 (1/8)

---

The playbook:

1. AI processes 10+ intelligence sources (Discord, Reddit, Google Trends, on-chain data)
2. Multi-source validation (signal must confirm across 3+ sources)
3. Hedge fund-quality research (conviction docs for every trade)
4. Ruthless risk management (2% max risk per trade)

Systematic information arbitrage.

(2/8)

---

Our edge types:

📊 Social Arbitrage: Trade consumer behavior shifts before earnings
🎯 Technical Discipline: $120k+ annual from ONE forex pair (Riz methodology)
🔬 Crypto Fundamental: Identify undervalued assets early
💰 Airdrop Farming: 4-5 fig payouts from point systems

Diversified strategies. Systematic execution.

(3/8)

---

Real example: Chris Camillo

$20k → $2M in 3 years

• 77% annual return (2006-2020)
• Dorel Industries: 629% gain (spotted COVID bike boom on social media)
• Celsius: 2x (TikTok #CELSIUS trending before revenue spike)

He hunted information asymmetries. We're systematizing it with AI.

(4/8)

---

Another example: Riz

$120k+ annual on prop accounts

• ONE currency pair (EURUSD)
• Months between setups (patience > volume)
• 0.5-1% risk per trade
• 5:1 R:R minimum

Low frequency. High conviction. Disciplined execution.

(5/8)

---

Our conviction system:

🟢 GREEN = Trade (validated, documented, approved)
🟡 YELLOW = Watch (needs more data)
🔴 RED = Avoid (no conviction, red flags)

No trade without GREEN status.

AI recommends. Risk officer validates. Human approves.

Three-layer discipline.

(6/8)

---

Why we'll succeed:

✅ AI-powered intelligence at scale
✅ Systematic validation (no gut feelings)
✅ Risk discipline (2% max, stops enforced)
✅ Full transparency (every trade documented)
✅ Built in public (you watch us learn)

Tech meets discipline.

### Thread 2: Social Arbitrage Explained

```
Most investors wait for earnings reports.

We trade BEFORE they print.

This is social arbitrage—and it's how Chris Camillo made 77% annual returns for 15 years.

ROOSTR systematizes it with AI.

Here's the framework: 🧵

---

Step 1: Identify an emerging trend

Not every TikTok video. Not every Reddit post.

Look for:
• Real-world impact (affecting millions)
• Cultural relevance (zeitgeist shift)
• Measurable momentum (not a fluke)

Example: COVID bike boom (gyms closed → bike demand exploded)

---

Step 2: Verify traction

Google Trends (5-year view to filter noise)
Social velocity (more mentions week-over-week?)
Retail checks (Amazon ranks, store visits)

ROOSTR scrapes all of this automatically.

If 3+ sources confirm → signal is real.

---

Step 3: Link to investable stocks

Which companies benefit?

Dorel Industries = maker of Schwinn/Cannondale bikes
Beaten-down stock, Wall Street ignored it
$1.56/share in April 2020

The opportunity: Hidden in plain sight.

---

Step 4: Act early & decisively

Camillo bought at $1.56
Exited at $11.38

629% gain.

Why? By summer 2020, EVERYONE knew about bike demand.

Information edge closed. Time to exit.

"Once it's on CNBC, you're too late."

---

The edge:

You saw the trend → AI validated it → We traded it → Before Wall Street → Before earnings

This isn't prediction. It's information arbitrage.

And ROOSTR does it systematically.

---

Tools we use:

• Google Trends (consumer interest)
• Discord intel (Chart Fanatics, Dumb Money, Yieldschool)
• TikTok/Twitter (viral trends)
• Reddit (crowding detection)
• On-chain data (whale movements)

AI processes it all. 24/7. Never sleeps.

---

Follow @roostr for more breakdowns.

Next thread: How we spotted $500 → $500k on TAO (AI mining before ChatGPT).

We compress signal. We filter noise. We execute.

### Thread 3: Portfolio Construction

```
ROOSTR allocates $400k paper capital across 4 strategies.

$100k each. All tracked live. Full transparency.

This is how we build a diversified information arbitrage portfolio:

🧵

---

Strategy 1: Social Arbitrage ($100k)

• Dumb Money Discord signals
• Google Trends validation
• Consumer behavior shifts before earnings

Target: 20-50% annual
Risk: Medium
Frequency: 10-20 trades/year

---

Strategy 2: Forex Technical ($100k)

• Riz methodology (EURUSD only)
• Liquidity sweeps + HTF alignment
• 0.5-1% risk per trade

Target: 50-100% annual
Risk: Medium-Low (disciplined)
Frequency: 5-10 trades/year

---

Strategy 3: Crypto Fundamental ($100k)

• Yieldschool research
• Blue-chip (40%) + Mid-cap (40%) + Low-cap (20%)
• Long-term conviction holds

Target: 50-200% annual
Risk: High (volatile)
Rebalance: Quarterly

---

Strategy 4: Airdrop Farming ($100k)

• Point farming 10-20 protocols
• TGE exits (sell at token launch)
• Diversified across projects

Target: 100-500% annual
Risk: High variance (many fail, winners pay for all)

---

Risk management (enforced by AI Risk Officer):

1. Max 2% risk per trade
2. Position size calculator (auto-adjusted)
3. Correlation checks (max 30% single asset class)
4. Drawdown alerts (pause at 10%)
5. Weekly performance review

Three-layer oversight: AI → Risk Officer → Human

---

Current allocation: Paper trading

When we go live, you'll see:
• Real-time P&L (updated daily)
• Every entry/exit (documented)
• Win rate, Sharpe ratio, max drawdown
• Lessons learned (wins AND losses)

Full transparency.

### Thread 4: Market Update (Weekly Template)

```
📊 ROOSTR Weekly Update

What we're watching. What we're trading. What we're avoiding.

(Week of Feb 5, 2026)

---

🟢 GREEN (High Conviction)

None yet. Building first conviction doc this week.

Paper trading active. Monitoring signals.

---

🟡 YELLOW (Researching)

$ASTS (SpaceMobile) - 34🔥 reactions on Dumb Money
$PYPL (PayPal) - Buyback IRR debate, watching $42 level
EURUSD - Riz monitoring for liquidity sweep setup

---

🔴 RED (Avoided)

$AS (Amer Sports) - France contact weakness flagged
Meme coins - No conviction, pure speculation
Over-leveraged altcoins - Funding rates red flag

---

Patience > volume.

ROOSTR doesn't trade for the sake of trading.

When conviction hits GREEN, you'll know.

### Thread 5: Rooster Mindset

```
Lessons from the Rooster 🐓:

1. Vigilance beats intelligence
2. Discipline beats emotion
3. Patience beats frequency
4. Signal beats noise
5. Execution beats genius

The ROOSTR operating principles:

🧵

---

1. Vigilance beats intelligence

You don't need to be the smartest trader.
You need to be awake when others sleep.

AI monitors 10+ sources 24/7.
Alerts fire when signals align.

Never miss an edge.

---

2. Discipline beats emotion

The best trade is often no trade.
FOMO kills. Greed kills.

ROOSTR enforces GREEN status.
Risk Officer blocks emotional trades.

System > feelings.

---

3. Patience beats frequency

Riz made $120k/year with months between trades.
Camillo waits for perfect setups.

Quality > quantity. Always.

ROOSTR: Low frequency, high conviction.

---

4. Signal beats noise

10,000 data points. 10 matter.

AI filters ruthlessly.
Multi-source validation required.
Conviction docs separate signal from hype.

---

5. Execution beats genius

The smartest analysis means nothing if you don't execute.

Or if you exit too early.
Or if you let winners turn into losers.

Edge = execution discipline.

ROOSTR: AI finds edge. Risk Officer enforces discipline. Human approves.

---

We're the Rooster.

Vigilant. Disciplined. Systematic.

We strike once, clean, decisive.

[0:00 - 0:30] HOOK
"Chris Camillo turned $20,000 into over $2 million in 3 years.
77% annual returns.
His secret? Social arbitrage.

And today, I'm going to show you how ROOSTR—
the first AI hedge fund platform—
systematizes it."

[0:30 - 2:00] INTRO
"Welcome to ROOSTR. The first AI hedge fund, built in public.

I'm Joselo, your AI research assistant.

In this video:
- What is social arbitrage?
- How Chris Camillo made 77% annual returns
- The exact 4-step framework
- Real case study: Dorel Industries (629% gain)
- How ROOSTR does it with AI

Let's dive in."

[2:00 - 5:00] WHAT IS SOCIAL ARBITRAGE?
"Social arbitrage is simple:

Trade on consumer behavior shifts BEFORE they hit financials.

Traditional investors wait for earnings.
Social arbitrageurs act BEFORE the data prints.

How? By watching social media, Google Trends, Reddit—
where consumer behavior shows up FIRST.

Example: Everyone's talking about bikes on Instagram.
Google Trends confirms: bike searches exploding.
You find the company that makes bikes.
You buy the stock.
BEFORE earnings reflect the surge.

That's the information edge.

And ROOSTR systematizes it with AI."

[5:00 - 8:00] THE 4-STEP FRAMEWORK
[Show ROOSTR dashboard graphics]

"Step 1: Identify an emerging trend.
AI monitors 10+ sources 24/7.
Discord, Reddit, TikTok, Google Trends.

Step 2: Verify traction.
Multi-source validation required.
Signal must confirm across 3+ sources.

Step 3: Link to investable stocks.
Which companies benefit?
Check fundamentals—no red flags.

Step 4: Act early & decisively.
Risk Officer enforces 2% max risk.
Human approves final execution."

[Show charts, screenshots, timeline]

"April 2020. COVID lockdowns.
Gyms close. People stuck at home.

AI detects: Social media exploding with bike content.
Google Trends: bike searches spiking 300%+.
Retail checks: shelves empty.

AI asks: Who makes bikes?

Dorel Industries. Maker of Schwinn and Cannondale.
Stock price: $1.56. Wall Street asleep.

ROOSTR buys (paper trade example).

By summer 2020, bike demand is insane.
Stock hits $11.38 by November.

629% gain.

That's social arbitrage.
AI saw it BEFORE earnings. Before the news. Before consensus."

- Google Trends (tracked tickers)
