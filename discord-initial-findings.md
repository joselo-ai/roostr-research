## 🎯 PRIMARY ASSET: WordsofRizdom (Admin)

**Background:**
- Prop trader, documented $120k+ payouts in 2025
- Trades EURUSD exclusively
- Transparent real-time journal in `🚨 riz` channel
- Server tag: CHRT

**Risk Management:**
- Consistent 0.5-1% risk per trade
- Returns: 5-10% per winning trade
- Payout frequency: 10-15% account growth before withdrawal
- Account sizes: $200k and $250k prop accounts

**Methodology:**
- Liquidity sweep entries (sweeping to left/right)
- Compound entries to stack positions
- Partial exits (usually 2.5-5 lots)
- Break-even adjustments after partials
- Counter-trend plays when DXY shows reversal potential
- Weekly open analysis
- Daily candle sweeps before entries

**Performance:**
- Jan 27 best trade: $15,000 profit
- Multiple stopped trades documented (transparent about losses)
- Gave back profits Jan 21 (Trump tariff volatility)
- Patience: "Months of no trading" in 2025, still profitable
- Direct quote: "I traded one pair all year last year, months of no trading at all due to my schedule and still did $120,000+ in payouts."

**Last Activity:** Jan 30 (no Feb activity yet)

**Key Quote:**
> "Risk 0.5-1% to gain 5%-10% trades. Anyone can do this, it's discipline and patience. It helps MASSIVELY that I don't have to rely on trading for money BUT that's what sacrifice in the short term means for the long term vision."

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

1. Check other Discord servers:

   - AI Trade Arena (YC algo trading)
   - Smart Trading Blueprint (20 unread)
   - Qantumtech (forex)

2. Build database in Notion:
   - Trader profiles
   - Trade setups with timestamps
   - Methodology documentation
   - Performance tracking

3. Research CRT methodology in detail

4. Monitor riz channel for WordsofRizdom's return (Feb activity expected)

5. Consider: Can we replicate Riz's approach?
   - EURUSD only
   - Liquidity sweep entries
   - 0.5-1% risk
   - Patience (low frequency)

## 💡 EDGE HYPOTHESIS

**WordsofRizdom's model:**
- One pair, deep understanding
- Patient, low-frequency (months off)
- Consistent risk (0.5-1%)
- High R:R (5-10% returns per trade)
- Prop accounts (no personal capital risk)
- Not reliant on trading income (reduces emotional pressure)

This is replicable. Focus, discipline, patience > volume.

**Rooster's take:** Riz is the signal. Others are noise unless proven otherwise.
