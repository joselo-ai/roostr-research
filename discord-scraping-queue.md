## 🐓 ROOSTER'S NOTES

**Meme Coins = High Risk, High Reward**

**Framework for coinmarketavenucapital scrape:**
1. **Quality Assessment First**
   - Look for conviction metrics (reaction counts, thesis docs)
   - Check for track record (verified gains, not just screenshots)
   - Detect pump-and-dump signals (excessive hype, no fundamentals)

2. **If Quality = Good:**
   - Extract high-conviction meme plays EARLY (before TikTok)
   - Apply Chris Camillo exit rules (mainstream = sell signal)
   - Small positions (Moonshots bucket: 1-2% per play, 10-20% total)

3. **If Quality = Bad:**
   - Skip or minimal monitoring
   - Don't waste time on pump-and-dump noise

**Risk Management for Meme Coins:**
- Max 1-2% position size (even if conviction high)
- Tight stops (20-30% below entry)
- Exit when mainstream (Twitter trending, TikTok viral)
- Take profits aggressively (50% at 2x, 30% at 5x, let 20% ride)

**Meme coins are NOT Riz setups.** High frequency, high volatility, low conviction. Treat as lottery tickets with edge.
