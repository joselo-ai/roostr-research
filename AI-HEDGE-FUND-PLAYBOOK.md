# AI HEDGE FUND PLAYBOOK
## How to Make Money Consistently: The Complete Intelligence Framework

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2026-02-05  
**Objective:** Build systematic edge through superior information gathering, analysis, and execution

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**The Edge:** Information asymmetry + systematic execution  
**The Goal:** Consistent returns across market regimes  
**The Method:** Multi-source intelligence → rigorous analysis → conviction-based execution

**Bottom Line:** We don't predict markets. We identify information gaps, act before they close, and manage risk ruthlessly.

## II. THE EDGE FRAMEWORK: How Information Becomes Profit

### **Edge Type 1: Information Arbitrage (Social Arbitrage)**
**Concept:** Trade on consumer behavior shifts before they hit financials  
**Source:** Dumb Money Discord, Google Trends, TikTok/Twitter

**Process:**
1. **Identify emerging trend** (real-world impact, cultural relevance)
2. **Verify traction** (Google Trends 5-year view, social velocity, Amazon ranks)
3. **Link to investable stocks** (which companies benefit? fundamentals solid?)
4. **Act early** (before earnings reports, before CNBC)
5. **Exit when mainstream** (monitor investor saturation, news coverage)

**Success Criteria:**
- Trend has **measurable momentum** (not a fluke)
- Company **positioned to capitalize** (no red flags)
- **Timing edge exists** (not yet priced in)
- **Multiple sources validate** (Google Trends + social + retail checks)

**Risk Management:**
- Position size: 5-10% of portfolio (high conviction only)
- Stop-loss: 15-20% below entry
- Exit trigger: Trend becomes mainstream OR fundamentals break

**Historical Returns:** Chris Camillo: ~77% annual (2006-2020), Dorel 629%, Celsius 2x

---

### **Edge Type 2: Technical Discipline (Riz Methodology)**
**Concept:** Low-frequency, high-conviction forex trades with ruthless risk management  
**Source:** WordsofRizdom (Chart Fanatics), CRT traders

**Process:**
1. **Single-pair focus** (EURUSD mastery > multi-pair noise)
2. **Wait for liquidity sweeps** (patience = months between setups)
3. **HTF alignment** (higher timeframe confirms direction)
4. **Compound entries** (add to winners, not losers)
5. **Partial exits + BE adjustments** (lock profits, eliminate risk)

**Success Criteria:**
- Setup has **swept liquidity** (stop hunts completed)
- **HTF aligned** (daily/weekly confirms direction)
- **Risk ≤ 1%** per trade (0.5% preferred)
- **R:R ≥ 5:1** (5-10% returns per winning trade)

**Risk Management:**
- Position size: 0.5-1% risk per trade
- Stop-loss: Placed beyond invalidation level
- Exit trigger: Partial at 1:2, move to BE, let runners go to 1:5+

**Historical Returns:** Riz: $120k+ annual on $200k+$250k prop accounts (months off)

---

### **Edge Type 3: Fundamental Research (Crypto Deep Dives)**
**Concept:** Identify undervalued crypto assets before market recognition  
**Source:** Yieldschool Research Hub, on-chain data

**Process:**
1. **Blue-chip allocation** (BTC/ETH/SOL = core holdings, 40-50% portfolio)
2. **Mid-cap picks** (projects with traction, <$10B market cap, 30-40%)
3. **Low-cap moonshots** (high-risk, high-reward, 10-20%)
4. **Yield strategies** (stablecoin yields, staking, LPs = income layer)

**Success Criteria:**
- Project has **real usage** (TVL, active users, transaction volume)
- **Tokenomics align** (buybacks, burns, or clear value accrual)
- **Team credible** (track record, transparency)
- **Narrative emerging** (AI, DeFi 2.0, RWA, etc.)

**Risk Management:**
- Blue-chips: Hold through cycles (BTC/ETH = portfolio anchors)
- Mid-caps: Take profits at 2x-5x, let runners ride
- Low-caps: Exit 50% at 10x, hold 50% for 100x potential
- Yield: 20%+ APY stablecoin strategies = cash flow

**Historical Returns:** Dan (YSL): $500 → $500k (1000x on TAO, early AI mining)

---

### **Edge Type 4: Airdrop Farming (Risk-Adjusted Free Money)**
**Concept:** Farm points on unannounced airdrops for 4-5 fig payouts  
**Source:** Yieldschool guides, crypto Twitter, Discord alpha

**Process:**
1. **Identify projects** with high airdrop probability (no token yet, VC-backed)
2. **Farm points** (trading volume, referrals, early user activity)
3. **Diversify** (farm 10-20 protocols simultaneously)
4. **Exit at TGE** (sell airdrop tokens immediately, rotate to next farm)

**Success Criteria:**
- Project has **VC backing** (funding = airdrop budget)
- **Point system active** (measurable progress)
- **Time investment low** (<30min/day per protocol)
- **Expected value positive** (even if 50% fail, winners pay for all)

**Risk Management:**
- Capital at risk: Minimal (mostly time + gas fees)
- Diversification: 10-20 farms (law of large numbers)
- Exit discipline: Sell 80-100% at TGE, don't get greedy

**Historical Returns:** Hyperliquid, Blast, Arbitrum airdrops = $10k-$100k+ for early farmers

---

## III. PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION: Asset Allocation Framework

### **The 4-Bucket System**

#### **Bucket 1: Core Holdings (40-50%)**
**Purpose:** Stability, long-term wealth preservation  
**Assets:** BTC, ETH, SOL (blue-chip crypto) OR cash/stablecoins in bear markets  
**Management:** Buy and hold, rebalance quarterly  
**Risk:** Low (blue-chips de-risk crypto exposure)

#### **Bucket 2: Conviction Plays (30-40%)**
**Purpose:** Alpha generation via information edge  
**Assets:** Social arbitrage stocks (Dumb Money signals), Mid-cap crypto (Yieldschool), Riz forex setups  
**Management:** High-conviction only (GREEN traffic light), 5-10% per position  
**Risk:** Medium (concentrated but researched)

#### **Bucket 3: Moonshots (10-20%)**
**Purpose:** Asymmetric upside, lottery tickets  
**Assets:** Low-cap crypto (Yieldschool), airdrop farms, meme coin rotations  
**Management:** Small positions, let winners run, cut losers fast  
**Risk:** High (expect 80% to fail, but winners = 10x-100x+)

#### **Bucket 4: Yield/Income (10-20%)**
**Purpose:** Cash flow, reduce portfolio volatility  
**Assets:** Stablecoin yields (20%+ APY strategies from Yieldschool), covered calls, theta strategies  
**Management:** Rotate to highest-yield opportunities, compound monthly  
**Risk:** Low-Medium (smart contract risk, but stablecoins = low price volatility)

---

### **Risk Management Rules (Non-Negotiable)**

1. **Never risk more than 2% of portfolio on single trade**
   - Conviction plays: 1% risk (tight stops)
   - Moonshots: 2% risk (wider stops, smaller size)

2. **Position sizing formula:**
   - Risk Amount = Portfolio Value × Risk %
   - Position Size = Risk Amount / (Entry Price - Stop Loss Price)

3. **Correlation awareness:**
   - Max 30% in single asset class during risk-on
   - Max 50% in crypto (rest in cash/stocks) during uncertainty
   - Diversify by **strategy** not just assets (social arb + forex + crypto ≠ correlated)

4. **Drawdown limits:**
   - Stop all new trades if portfolio down 10% from peak
   - Review strategy if down 15%
   - Hard stop / pivot strategy if down 20%

5. **Profit-taking discipline:**
   - Take 20% off table at 2x
   - Take 30% off at 5x
   - Let 50% ride for 10x+
   - **Never regret profits** (greed kills)

---

## IV. THE CONVICTION SYSTEM: Traffic Light Framework

### **🟢 GREEN = Trade**
**Criteria:**
- Multiple sources validate (social data + fundamentals + technicals)
- Conviction doc written (thesis, risk, reward, exit plan)
- Risk management defined (position size, stop loss, profit targets)
- G approves (final human check)

**Action:** Execute immediately, no hesitation

---

### **🟡 YELLOW = Watch**
**Criteria:**
- Interesting signal but incomplete validation
- Needs more data (Google Trends, fundamentals, technicals)
- Timing uncertain (trend emerging but not confirmed)

**Action:** Monitor daily, gather more intel, move to GREEN or RED within 7 days

---

### **🔴 RED = Avoid**
**Criteria:**
- No conviction (weak signals, conflicting data)
- Red flags present (fundamentals broken, crowding detected)
- Already mainstream (information edge closed)

**Action:** Do nothing. Patience > volume.

---

## X. ROOSTER'S RULES: Operating Principles

1. **Strike once, clean, decisive.**
   - Don't chase. Don't FOMO. Wait for setup.

2. **Patience > volume.**
   - Riz made $120k/year with months off. Quality > quantity.

3. **Compress signal, filter noise.**
   - Not every trend is tradeable. Most aren't.

4. **Risk management is non-negotiable.**
   - 2% max risk. Stops placed. No exceptions.

5. **Conviction before capital.**
   - Write the doc. Get it to GREEN. Then trade.

6. **Exit when mainstream.**
   - Information edge closes fast. Sell into strength.

7. **Learn from every trade.**
   - Win or lose, extract the lesson. Update MEMORY.md.

8. **Protect G's capital like it's mine.**
   - Because it is. Discipline = loyalty.
