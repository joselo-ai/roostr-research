FRIDAY AFTERNOON POST (4 PM - Feb 14, 2026)
==========================================

ORIGINAL PLAN: Week recap with position data (ALL, PGR, KTB)
BLOCKER: Price data corrupted (stock tickers mapping to crypto on CoinGecko)
BLOCKER: Browser automation service unavailable

ALTERNATIVE POST (deployed instead):
-------------------------------------

Week 2 lessons:

🎯 Multi-agent validation works
   18 AI agents scoring every trade before entry
   
🛡️ Risk management matters
   Position sizing by conviction (6-10/10 scale)
   Stop losses non-negotiable
   
📊 Data quality is edge
   Garbage in = garbage out
   Building better price infrastructure now
   
🔄 Process > perfection
   Systems fail. Learn. Improve. Iterate.

Full performance breakdown this weekend.
