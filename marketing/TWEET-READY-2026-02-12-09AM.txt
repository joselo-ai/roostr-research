Position sizing = conviction scoring:

Portfolio: $100k

$ALL (10/10): $20k (20%) — Highest conviction
$PGR (9/10): $15k (15%) — Second highest
$KTB (7.5/10): $10k (10%) — Diversification

Size follows conviction.
Stops at -8% to -10%.
Max loss if all hit stops: $3.8k (3.8%).

Risk-adjusted by score.
