Social arbitrage in action. 🐓

$KTB (Kontoor Brands - Wrangler/Lee/Helly Hansen)

BEFORE: Dumb Money Discord signal
• 18 👍 + 4 🔥 reactions
• "40% undervalued" - Gordo
• Helly Hansen integration ahead of schedule
• Community building conviction

AFTER: Position deployed
• $10,000 @ $67.03
• ROE 49.11% (exceptional)
• Analyst target $84.56 (+26%)
• Stop loss $63 (2% max risk)

This is how social arbitrage works: spot the signal before Wall Street wakes up.

Not hyped. Not crowded. Just quiet strength.

Chris Camillo did this for 77% annual returns (2006-2020). We're following the playbook.

Portfolio construction: Week 1. 🐓

$100k starting capital allocated across 4 buckets:

📊 Deployed (22%):
• $ACGL: $12k (value)
• $KTB: $10k (social arb)

💵 Cash (40%):
• Dry powder for opportunities
• Risk buffer
• No FOMO

🎯 Reserved (38%):
• Social Arb: $20k (waiting for signals)
• Value: $28k (screening candidates)
• Crypto: $18k (conviction docs in progress)

Why so much cash?

Week 1 = validation. We're testing:
• Signal quality
• Risk management
• Execution discipline

If ACGL + KTB work → scale up.
If they don't → lessons learned, adjust.

Patience > volume.

## Post 5: Research Process Behind-the-Scenes

### Design Specs
- **Format:** Carousel (6 slides)
- **Dimensions:** 1080x1080px
- **Style:** Flowchart/process visualization

### Slide 1: Cover
```
[Background: Dark slate]

🐓 HOW WE HUNT

The roostr Research Process

From Signal → Conviction Doc → Trade

[Subtitle: Multi-source intelligence in action]
```

### Slide 2: Step 1 - Gather Signals
```
STEP 1: GATHER SIGNALS

Sources (10+):
📱 Dumb Money Discord
📊 Stock screeners (Finviz, Yahoo)
🗞️ News aggregators (Bloomberg, CNBC)
📈 Technical scanners (TradingView)
🔍 Google Trends
💬 Social sentiment (Twitter, Reddit)
🎤 Earnings calls
📉 Insider trading activity
🏦 Analyst reports
🤖 AI news summarization

Goal: Cast a wide net.
Quality signals are rare.
```

### Slide 3: Step 2 - Validate
```
STEP 2: VALIDATE

Multi-source check:
✓ Social signal (18+ reactions)
✓ Fundamental screen (P/E, ROE, debt)
✓ Technical confirmation (chart, volume)
✓ Catalyst identified (earnings, news)
✓ Analyst support (upgrades, targets)

If 4/5 = YELLOW (watch)
If 5/5 = proceed to conviction doc

Single-source plays = ignore.
```

### Slide 4: Step 3 - Build Conviction Doc
```
STEP 3: CONVICTION DOC

Document structure:
• Thesis (1-2 sentences)
• Fundamentals (data table)
• Catalysts (what moves it)
• Risks (what breaks it)
• Entry strategy (price, size, stops)
• Targets (take-profit levels)
• Conviction rating (1-10)

Time to complete: 2-4 hours
If rating < 7/10 = YELLOW or RED

No doc, no trade.
```

### Slide 5: Step 4 - Traffic Light System
```
STEP 4: STATUS ASSIGNMENT

🟢 GREEN = Trade NOW
• Conviction 8-10/10
• Multiple sources validated
• Clear catalyst
• Risk/reward >3:1
• Approved for deployment

🟡 YELLOW = Watch
• Conviction 6-7/10
• Needs more data
• 7-day validation window
• Re-evaluate Friday

🔴 RED = Avoid
• Conviction <6/10
• Red flags present
• Already mainstream
• Poor risk/reward
```

### Slide 6: Step 5 - Execute & Review
```
STEP 5: EXECUTE & REVIEW

Execution:
• Enter at planned price
• Set stop loss immediately
• Size position (2% max risk)
• Log in trade journal

Post-trade review:
• What went right?
• What went wrong?
• Update conviction doc
• Share lessons publicly

Process > outcome.

System improvement = edge.
```

```
Behind the scenes: How we hunt information asymmetries. 🐓

This is the roostr research process:

1️⃣ Gather signals (10+ sources)
2️⃣ Validate multi-source (not just hype)
3️⃣ Build conviction doc (2-4 hours each)
4️⃣ Traffic light status (🟢🟡🔴)
5️⃣ Execute & review (learn from every trade)

Why this works:

• Multi-source = filters noise
• Conviction docs = forces deep research
• Traffic lights = removes emotion
• Reviews = continuous improvement
• Transparency = accountability

This took 6 months to build. We're refining it daily.

Every GREEN trade you see went through this process. No shortcuts. No gut feelings.

Chris Camillo used this for 77% annual returns.
Riz uses this for $120k/year.
We're following proven frameworks.

## Design Production Notes

**Tools:**
- Figma or Canva for layout
- TradingView for chart screenshots
- Python (matplotlib) for pie chart generation
- Monospace font for all data displays

**Brand Consistency:**
- Always use roostr color palette (orange, dark slate, signal green)
- Always include 🐓 in corner or header
- Terminal aesthetic = trust signal (not flashy, just data)
- White space = calm, not cluttered

**Engagement Tactics:**
- First comment: Pin a detailed breakdown or link to conviction doc
- Stories: Repost with "Swipe for full breakdown" CTA
- Ask questions in stories: "Which position do you like more?"
- Behind-the-scenes: Terminal screenshots, research notes

**Hashtag Strategy:**
- Use all 30 hashtags (Instagram limit)
- Mix: trading (broad) + specific stocks + methodology
- Rotate trending finance hashtags weekly
- Monitor which hashtags drive profile visits

---

## Success Metrics (Week 2)

**Goals:**
- Reach: 5,000+ accounts
- Engagement rate: 5%+ (likes + comments / followers)
- Profile visits: 200+
- Link clicks: 50+
- Follower growth: +100-200

**Track:**
- Which post performs best (save for future template)
- What questions people ask (FAQ content ideas)
- Which hashtags drive traffic
- Story completion rate

**Iterate:**
- If carousels outperform singles → more carousels
- If performance updates get most engagement → weekly updates
- If BTS process content flops → reduce educational content

## roostr Instagram Content Principles

1. **Data > words** - Show charts, tables, numbers
2. **Transparency > perfection** - Share losses, not just wins
3. **Process > outcome** - How we think matters more than P&L
4. **Calm > hype** - No 🚀, no FOMO, no promises
5. **Education > promotion** - Teach, don't sell

Every post should answer: "What can they learn from this?"

If it's just bragging → delete it.
If it's teaching + transparency → post it.

**Brand voice maintained: Calm. Precise. Transparent. No hype. Just edge.** 🐓
