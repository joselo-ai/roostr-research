# Capital Flow Academy - Risk Map

## Risk Assessment Framework

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- **Likelihood:** Low (10%) | Medium (40%) | High (70%)
- **Impact:** Low ($0-$10k loss) | Medium ($10k-$100k) | High (>$100k or business failure)
- **Priority:** Likelihood × Impact

---

## 🔴 HIGH RISK (Address Immediately)

### 1. Regulatory Enforcement (SEC/FINRA)
**Likelihood:** Medium (40%)  
**Impact:** High (business shutdown, fines, legal fees >$100k)  
**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL

**Scenario:**
- SEC interprets our "educational signals" as investment advice
- Requires RIA registration retroactively
- Fines for operating without license
- Member lawsuits for losses

**Mitigation:**
✅ Hire securities attorney for pre-launch review ($5k)  
✅ Explicit disclaimers on every signal  
✅ Member agreement with arbitration clause  
✅ Never give personalized advice  
✅ Annual compliance audit  
✅ E&O insurance ($2k/year)  

**Monitoring:**
- Track SEC enforcement actions monthly
- Join compliance newsletters (InvestmentNews)
- Stay updated on IA regulations

**Residual Risk:** Low (with proper compliance)

---

### 2. Member Lawsuit (Trading Losses)
**Likelihood:** Medium (30%)  
**Impact:** Medium ($20k-$50k legal defense, reputational damage)  
**Priority:** 🔴 HIGH

**Scenario:**
- Member loses $50k following our signals
- Claims we gave "investment advice" despite disclaimers
- Sues for negligence, fraud, or breach of fiduciary duty
- Even if we win, legal costs drain cash

**Mitigation:**
✅ Ironclad member agreement (signed on signup)  
✅ Arbitration clause (avoid court)  
✅ LLC structure (shield personal assets)  
✅ E&O insurance (covers legal fees)  
✅ Document everything (proof of disclaimers)  
✅ Never promise returns  

**Monitoring:**
- Track member complaints (Discord, email)
- Address grievances quickly
- Maintain complaint log

**Residual Risk:** Low (with insurance + LLC)

---

### 3. Platform Dependency (Circle.so, Stripe)
**Likelihood:** Low (10%)  
**Impact:** High (revenue disruption, member churn)  
**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM

**Scenario:**
- Circle.so shuts down or raises prices 10x
- Stripe freezes account (high-risk merchant)
- Lose access to members, content, payments

**Mitigation:**
✅ Weekly data backups (member list, content)  
✅ Maintain email list outside platform (ConvertKit)  
✅ Diversify payments (Stripe + PayPal)  
✅ Have migration plan (move to Teachable, Skool)  

**Monitoring:**
- Monitor platform health (Twitter, status pages)
- Keep contact with Circle.so support
- Review ToS changes

**Residual Risk:** Medium (unavoidable platform risk)

---

## 🟡 MEDIUM RISK (Monitor & Mitigate)

### 4. High Member Churn (>15%/month)
**Likelihood:** Medium (40%)  
**Impact:** Medium (MRR stagnation, poor LTV:CAC)  
**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM

**Scenario:**
- Members don't see value (no profitable trades)
- Onboarding confusing, content overwhelming
- Community not engaging
- Churn >15% = treadmill (can't grow)

**Mitigation:**
✅ Onboarding sequence (7 emails, clear first steps)  
✅ Quick wins program (first trade in 30 days)  
✅ Community engagement (live calls, accountability)  
✅ Certification gamification (badges, levels)  
✅ Track engagement (who hasn't logged in 7 days)  

**Monitoring:**
- Weekly churn report (who canceled, why)
- Exit surveys (ask departing members)
- Cohort analysis (Month 1 vs Month 6 churn)

**Residual Risk:** Low (if onboarding strong)

---

### 5. Paid Ad Inefficiency (CAC >$300)
**Likelihood:** Medium (50%)  
**Impact:** Medium (slow growth, unprofitable)  
**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM

**Scenario:**
- Facebook/Google ads don't convert
- CAC climbs to $300-$500
- LTV:CAC ratio <3:1 (unprofitable)
- Burn through $20k in ads, no ROI

**Mitigation:**
✅ Start small ($50/day, test creatives)  
✅ Optimize funnel (landing page A/B tests)  
✅ Retargeting (pixel website visitors)  
✅ Organic focus (SEO, YouTube, referrals)  
✅ Set CAC ceiling ($200 max)  

**Monitoring:**
- Daily ad performance (CTR, CPA, conversion)
- Weekly ROI analysis (CAC vs LTV)
- Pause if CAC >$250

**Residual Risk:** Medium (ads are unpredictable)

---

### 6. Founder Burnout
**Likelihood:** High (60%)  
**Impact:** Low (slow growth, morale drop, not fatal)  
**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM

**Scenario:**
- You work 80 hours/week for 6 months
- No time for content, calls, community
- Member experience declines
- Churn increases, growth stalls

**Mitigation:**
✅ Batch content (record 4 weeks at once)  
✅ Automate onboarding (email sequences)  
✅ Hire VA (community manager, editor)  
✅ Set work hours (20 hours/week max)  
✅ Take 1 week off every quarter  

**Monitoring:**
- Weekly time audit (where are hours going)
- Delegate tasks >$25/hour
- Hire when MRR >$20k

**Residual Risk:** Low (with discipline)

---

## 🟢 LOW RISK (Accept or Monitor)

### 7. Market Crash (Bear Market)
**Likelihood:** Medium (30% in next 2 years)  
**Impact:** Low (actually helps, volatility = options premium)  
**Priority:** 🟢 LOW

**Scenario:**
- S&P drops 30%
- Members panic, stop trading
- Some cancel memberships

**Mitigation:**
✅ Teach defensive strategies (puts, cash)  
✅ Position as "income in any market"  
✅ Show bear market case studies (2008, 2020)  
✅ Volatility = higher premiums (covered calls)  

**Monitoring:**
- Track VIX (>30 = high volatility)
- Adjust content (more hedging strategies)

**Residual Risk:** Low (opportunity in disguise)

---

### 8. Competitor Launch
**Likelihood:** High (80%)  
**Impact:** Low (market is huge, multiple winners)  
**Priority:** 🟢 LOW

**Scenario:**
- Another options education platform launches
- They copy our pricing, content, messaging
- Some members switch

**Mitigation:**
✅ Build strong community (moat)  
✅ Lock in pricing (founding members)  
✅ Proprietary SaaS tools (Tier 3)  
✅ Personal brand (founder as face)  
✅ Focus on results (testimonials)  

**Monitoring:**
- Track competitor offerings (once/quarter)
- Survey members (why they stay)
- Double down on differentiation

**Residual Risk:** Low (community = sticky)

### 9. Tech Outage (Zoom, Discord, Website)
**Likelihood:** Medium (20%)  
**Impact:** Low (temporary inconvenience, not fatal)  
**Priority:** 🟢 LOW

**Scenario:**

**Residual Risk:** Low (short-term only)

**Impact:** Low (manageable with transparency)  
**Priority:** 🟢 LOW

**Scenario:**
- Disgruntled member posts "scam" review
- Reddit thread: "Capital Flow Academy didn't work for me"
- Competitor spreads FUD

**Mitigation:**
✅ Respond professionally (acknowledge, don't argue)  
✅ Show real testimonials (video, verified)  
✅ Transparency (share wins AND losses)  
✅ Money-back guarantee (30 days)  
✅ Over-deliver on value  

**Monitoring:**
- Google Alerts (brand name mentions)
- Reddit/Twitter search (weekly)
- Review sites (Trustpilot, BBB)

**Residual Risk:** Low (1-2 bad reviews won't kill business)
