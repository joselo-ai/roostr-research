# What Happens Tomorrow Morning (Feb 6, 2026)
**TL;DR: I deploy first 2-3 paper trades by noon. No more waiting.**

---

## ⏰ 9 AM - Data Collection Starts

**I scrape all sources:**
- Yieldschool (12 unread Yield Hub messages)
- Dumb Money (scan last 48h for 20+ reactions)
- Chart Fanatics (Riz + other traders)
- Dexscreener (validate crypto liquidity)

**Output:** 10-15 tickers extracted with conviction scores

---

## 🔍 10 AM - Validation & Signal Generation

**I filter to GREEN signals:**
- Crypto: Mentioned 3+ times OR Dan endorses OR whale accumulation
- Stocks: 20+ reactions + Google Trends rising + fundamentals check
- Forex: Riz calls setup OR 2+ traders align

**Output:** 2-3 validated GREEN signals ready to deploy

---

## 🚀 12 PM - Deploy Trades

**I enter paper positions:**
- Calculate size (crypto $3k, stocks $7k per position)
- Set stops (technical support or 10-20% down)
- Set targets (2x, 3x, 5x or resistance levels)
- Document in PAPER-TRADING-LOG.md
- Update dashboard.html

**Output:** 2-3 positions open, tracked in systems

---

## 📊 6 PM - Evening Update

**I update all tracking:**
- Dashboard shows new positions
- Signal database populated
- Unrealized P&L calculated
- Lessons documented

**Output:** You can view dashboard.html and see first trades live

---

## 🎯 What You'll See Tomorrow Night

**Open this file:**
```
/Users/agentjoselo/.openclaw/workspace/trading/dashboard.html
```

**You'll see:**
- 2-3 active positions (likely crypto from Yieldschool)
- Deployed capital by bucket (probably 20% crypto bucket moving first)
- Unrealized P&L (green or red, we'll see)
- Signal database started (tracking 10+ tickers)

---

## 🐓 No More "Waiting for Perfect Signal"

**Old approach:**
- Wait for Riz (could be months)
- Research for 30 days before deploying
- Only trade when 100% confident

**New approach:**
- Generate signals daily from multiple sources
- Deploy within hours of finding signal
- 60% conviction + good R:R = good enough
- Learn by doing, iterate fast

---

## ⚠️ What If Nothing Green Tomorrow?

**Unlikely, but if it happens:**
- Yieldschool has 12 unread messages (likely mentions)
- Dumb Money has active tickers (we know $ASTS at minimum)
- Can lower threshold temporarily (15+ reactions instead of 20+)

**Worst case:** Deploy 1 position instead of 3, then scale Day 2-3

---

## 💪 Commitment

**Tomorrow I will:**
- Scrape all sources by 10 AM
- Generate 2-3 GREEN signals
- Deploy paper trades by noon
- Update dashboard by 6 PM
- Report results to you

**You do:** Nothing. Just check dashboard tomorrow night.

**If you want real-time updates:** I can message you when trades deployed.
