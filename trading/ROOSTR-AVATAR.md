### Daily Update (30-45 sec)
```
"Morning. Here's where we stand.

TAO down 7%, SOL flat. RSI showing oversold on both.

Top priority today: EURUSD setup from Riz, 9/10 conviction.

No panic. Stops are protected. Building in public.

That's it."
```

### System Update (30 sec)
```
"Quick update.

We just integrated TradingView. Real-time data, no rate limits, 
RSI indicators live.

20 minutes to build. Already running.

This is what automation looks like."
```

### Weekly Recap (60 sec)
```
"Week recap.

Started at $100K. Now at $98.7K. Down 1.3% for the week.

TAO took a hit, down 11%. SOL holding steady.

Lesson learned: Oversold RSI doesn't mean instant bounce. 
Need catalyst confirmation.

3 new systems deployed: TradingView integration, webhook alerts, 
risk monitor upgrade.

Infrastructure matters. We're building the right way.

See you Monday."
```
