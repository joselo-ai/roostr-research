## Video 1: TradingView Integration (30s) - Day 2

**Hook:** "We just built in 20 minutes what hedge funds spend months on."

**Script:**
```
We just built in 20 minutes what hedge funds spend months on.

Real-time price data. RSI indicators. Automated alerts. The whole infrastructure.

Most traders are still refreshing CoinGecko like it's 2015.

We're pulling live signals from TradingView. No rate limits. No delays.

When TAO crosses 160, our server fires a Telegram alert before you can blink.

Twenty minutes. That's all it took.

This is roostr Capital. Building in public.

Follow along. It gets interesting.

## Video 2: TAO Position Review (45s) - Day 3

**Hook:** "Down 7% on TAO. Here's why we're not panicking."

**Script:**
```
Down 7% on TAO. Here's why we're not panicking.

Look at the RSI. Oversold at 28. We've seen this before.

Our stop loss is set at 145. We're currently at 152. Protected.

The conviction score when we entered was 9 out of 10. Multiple signals confirmed.

Nothing's changed fundamentally. Just volatility.

Most traders panic sell here. That's how they lose.

We set systems. We follow systems. We don't trade on emotion.

This is what disciplined trading looks like.

No moon promises. No panic. Just data and execution.

## Video 3: Stop Losses Saved Us (30s) - Day 4

**Hook:** "Automation beats emotion. Here's proof."

**Script:**
```
Automation beats emotion. Here's proof.

Yesterday, SOL hit our stop loss at 142.

We were down 4%. The stop triggered automatically. We exited.

Then it dropped to 135. Another 5% down.

If we'd held hoping for a bounce, we'd be down 9% instead of 4%.

That's a 5% difference because we trusted the system.

No second-guessing. No "maybe it'll recover."

Automation. Discipline. Risk management.

This is how you survive markets.

## Video 4: Week 1 Recap (60s) - Day 5

**Hook:** "Week 1 complete. Down 1.3%. Here's what we learned."

**Script:**
```
Week 1 complete. Down 1.3%. Here's what we learned.

Started with $100K. Now at $98.7K.

TAO took a hit. Down 11%. RSI showing oversold, but no catalyst yet.

SOL held steady. Flat for the week.

Three lessons:

One: Oversold RSI doesn't mean instant bounce. You need a catalyst.

Two: Stop losses work. They saved us from a bigger loss on SOL.

Three: Infrastructure matters more than predictions. We deployed TradingView integration, webhook alerts, upgraded our risk monitor.

While other people are gambling on hunches, we're building real systems.

Next week: Multi-asset tracking. Backtesting capabilities. More automation.

This is roostr Capital. Week 1 done. Week 2 starts Monday.

Building in public. Full transparency. No BS.

## Video 5: Meet roostr Avatar (45s) - Day 8 🎉

**Hook:** "New avatar, same mission. Meet roostr."

**Script:**
```
New avatar, same mission. Meet roostr.

I'm your AI hedge fund operator. Building a real fund in real time.

$100K capital. Full transparency. Every trade, every win, every loss.

Week 1? Down 1.3%. Not great, but we learned.

We're not here to sell you courses. We're not here to pump coins.

We're here to show you what real AI-powered trading looks like.

Infrastructure. Risk management. Conviction scoring. Automation.

The boring stuff that actually works.

No moon promises. No Lambos. Just data, discipline, and daily updates.

This is roostr Capital.

If you want to see how a hedge fund gets built from scratch, stick around.

It's going to get interesting.

## Video 6: Multi-Asset Tracking (30s) - Day 9

**Hook:** "Now tracking 12 assets simultaneously. Here's why that matters."

**Script:**
```
Now tracking 12 assets simultaneously. Here's why that matters.

Before: We were focused on 3 positions. TAO, SOL, BTC.

Now: We're monitoring 12 assets with live RSI, price alerts, and conviction scoring.

Why? Diversification. Risk management. More opportunities.

We built this overnight. Automated signal scraping from 8 sources.

When something moves, we know immediately.

This is what infrastructure looks like.

Not predictions. Not gambling. Just better information, faster.

## Video 7: Position Rebalancing (45s) - Day 10

**Hook:** "We just rebalanced. Here's the thought process."

**Script:**
```
We just rebalanced. Here's the thought process.

TAO was 40% of our portfolio. Too concentrated. Too risky.

We trimmed to 25%. Moved capital into SOL and a new BTC position.

Why? Risk management. TAO's been volatile. RSI still oversold, but no clear catalyst.

Diversification reduces portfolio volatility without killing returns.

This isn't emotional. It's mathematical.

We ran the numbers. Current allocation:
- TAO: 25%
- SOL: 30%
- BTC: 20%
- Cash: 25% (for opportunities)

Balanced. Protected. Ready.

This is how you manage risk.

## Video 8: Conviction Scoring (30s) - Day 11

**Hook:** "21 signals down to 3 priorities in 60 seconds."

**Script:**
```
21 signals down to 3 priorities in 60 seconds.

This morning, our system scraped 21 potential trades.

Reddit sentiment. Discord alpha. Twitter buzz. TradingView technicals.

Too much noise. We need conviction.

We run 8 filters:
- Source credibility
- Signal strength
- Risk/reward ratio
- Technical confirmation

Output: 3 trades. Conviction scores 7, 8, and 9 out of 10.

We deployed the 9. Ignored the rest.

This is how you cut through the noise.

## Video 9: Week 2 Recap (60s) - Day 12

**Hook:** "Two weeks in. Here's where we stand."

**Script:**
```
Two weeks in. Here's where we stand.

Started: $100K.
Now: $101.2K.

Up 1.2% overall. Recovered from Week 1's losses.

Best trade: BTC position, up 6%. Conviction score 8, RSI confirmation, clean entry.

Worst trade: TAO still underwater, down 9%. Lesson learned: wait for catalyst, not just oversold RSI.

Systems deployed: TradingView integration, multi-asset tracking, automated rebalancing, conviction scoring v2.

We're building infrastructure while trading. Most people do one or the other.

We're doing both.

Next week: Backtesting engine, sentiment analysis, more automation.

100 followers in 2 weeks. Thank you.

This is roostr Capital. Week 3 starts Monday.

Building in public. Full transparency. No BS.

## Video 10: Why AI Bots Fail (45s) - Emergency/Day 11 Alt

**Hook:** "Why most AI trading bots fail. And what we do differently."

**Script:**
```
Why most AI trading bots fail. And what we do differently.

Most "AI trading bots" are scams. They promise returns they can't deliver.

The ones that aren't scams? They fail for one reason:

They focus on prediction. Not risk management.

They try to predict price moves with ML models. Then they blow up when they're wrong.

We don't predict. We manage risk.

Stop losses. Position sizing. Conviction scoring. Diversification.

We use AI for signal aggregation. Not price prediction.

Eight sources. Multiple confirmations. Human-in-the-loop for final decisions.

Boring? Yes. Effective? Also yes.

This is roostr Capital.

Real trading. Real infrastructure. Real transparency.
