# Stock Edge Research - roostr
**Status:** 🔴 MISSING - Need to develop before allocating capital  
**Priority:** HIGH (blocking 10% opportunistic bucket deployment for stocks)

---

## 🎯 Objective

**Develop systematic stock trading edge** beyond social arbitrage.

**Why needed:**
- Currently only have $ASTS (6.8/10 YELLOW, speculative)
- Social arb covers consumer behavior → earnings lag
- Missing: fundamental value, dividends, sector rotation, technical patterns
- Can't allocate $10k opportunistic bucket to stocks without methodology

## 📊 Potential Stock Edges to Explore

### 1. Dividend Aristocrats (Value + Income)
**Thesis:** Companies that increase dividends 25+ consecutive years  
**Edge:** Predictable cash flow, lower volatility, compound growth  
**Research needed:**
- Track Dividend Aristocrats list
- Backtest buying on pullbacks
- Compare yields vs S&P 500
- Find entry rules (P/E < X, yield > Y%)

**Example tickers:** JNJ, PG, KO, MCD, WMT  
**Conviction:** TBD (need to validate)

---

### 2. Earnings Plays (Social Arb Subset)
**Thesis:** Pre-earnings signals from social media, product launches  
**Edge:** Position before earnings beat → post-earnings pop  
**Research needed:**
- Already covered by social arb framework
- May not need separate bucket
- Could be integrated into 30% social arb allocation

**Note:** Might be redundant - Camillo's methodology already includes this

---

### 3. Sector Rotation (Macro-Driven)
**Thesis:** Rotate between sectors based on economic cycle  
**Edge:** Energy in inflation, tech in recovery, utilities in recession  
**Research needed:**
- Define sector ETFs (XLE, XLK, XLU, XLF, etc.)
- Backtest rotation signals (yield curve, Fed policy, GDP)
- Build systematic rules

**Conviction:** TBD (macro timing is hard)

---

### 4. Technical Breakouts (Pattern-Based)
**Thesis:** Chart patterns repeat, volatility compression → expansion  
**Edge:** Systematic entry on breakouts, momentum continuation  
**Research needed:**
- Define patterns (cup/handle, ascending triangle, bull flags)
- Backtest win rates
- Build scanner for setups
- Validate with paper trades

**Similar to:** Riz's liquidity sweep methodology but for stocks

---

## 🔍 Research Sources to Mine

### Discord Servers (Stock Traders)
**Priority 1: Find systematic stock traders**
- Scan Dumb Money for stock-focused members (beyond social arb)
- Check if Chart Fanatics has stock traders (currently only Riz forex)
- Join stock-specific Discords if needed

**What to look for:**
- Documented track records
- Repeatable methodology
- Not just tips, but process

---

### Traditional Value Investors
**Books/Resources:**
- Warren Buffett's letters (value investing)
- Joel Greenblatt's Magic Formula
- Benjamin Graham's "Intelligent Investor"

**Validate:**
- Can we systematize their rules?
- What's the edge in 2026? (markets efficient now?)
- Backtest on recent data

---

### Quantitative Screening
**Build stock screeners:**
- P/E < 15, PEG < 1, Debt/Equity < 0.5
- Dividend yield > 3%, payout ratio < 60%
- Revenue growth > 10%, positive FCF
- Insider buying signals

**Tool:** Python + yfinance or similar

## 📋 Action Plan (Priority Order)

### Week 1 (Next 7 days)
- [ ] Scan Dumb Money Discord for systematic stock traders
- [ ] Research Dividend Aristocrats list + methodology
- [ ] Build simple stock screener (value metrics)
- [ ] Document findings in conviction doc

### Week 2-3 (Next 14-21 days)
- [ ] Paper trade 5 dividend aristocrat entries (test methodology)
- [ ] Backtest technical breakout patterns
- [ ] Join stock-focused Discord if needed
- [ ] Validate if earnings plays are redundant with social arb

### Week 4 (30 days)
- [ ] Choose 1 stock edge to focus on (highest conviction)
- [ ] Build conviction doc for stock strategy
- [ ] Paper trade 10+ stock setups
- [ ] Measure win rate, R:R, drawdown

### Month 2-3 (60-90 days)
- [ ] Validate stock edge with 20+ paper trades
- [ ] If >60% win rate → allocate $10k opportunistic bucket to stocks
- [ ] If <60% win rate → keep researching or abandon stocks

## ⚠️ Red Flags to Avoid

**Don't fall into:**
- Tip-following (no edge, just noise)
- Overcomplicating (100 indicators = paralysis)
- Recency bias (what worked last year may not work now)
- Ignoring risk management (stops, position sizing)

**Must have:**
- Repeatable process
- Documented edge (why does it work?)
- Backtest validation
- Track record (paper or real)

---

## 🎯 Success Definition

**Stock edge validated when:**
- [ ] Methodology documented in conviction doc
- [ ] 20+ paper trades executed
- [ ] Win rate >60%
- [ ] Avg R:R >2:1
- [ ] Max drawdown <20%
- [ ] Can explain WHY the edge exists

**Then:** Allocate $10k opportunistic bucket to stock plays  
**Otherwise:** Keep $10k for $ASTS-style speculative opportunities only

---

## 📊 Current Stock Coverage

**What we have:**
- Social Arbitrage: Consumer behavior → stock earnings lag (Camillo methodology)
- Speculative: $ASTS (satellite-to-cell, high risk/reward)

**What we're missing:**
- Systematic value/dividend plays
- Technical breakout methodology
- Sector rotation strategy

**Priority:** Find 1 stock edge to validate, not 3-4 mediocre ones.

---

**Next Action:** Scan Dumb Money Discord for systematic stock traders (not just social arb).
