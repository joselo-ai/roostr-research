# Daily Data Collection & Signal Generation Framework
**Status:** 🟢 ACTIVE - Deploying Tomorrow (Feb 6, 2026)  
**Owner:** Joselo 🐓

---

## 🎯 AGGRESSIVE EXECUTION MANDATE

**Old approach:** Wait for perfect signals, research for weeks  
**New approach:** Collect data daily, generate signals myself, deploy fast

**G's directive:** "Do it yourself every day and start deploying tomorrow"

**Mindset shift:**
- Don't wait for Riz's next setup (could be months)
- Don't wait for perfect research (iterate in market)
- Generate GREEN signals from multiple data sources
- Deploy paper trades TOMORROW
- Learn by doing, not planning

---

## 📊 DATA SOURCES (Active Daily Collection)

### 1. Yieldschool (Crypto Research)
**Access:** ✅ Already have access  
**Data to collect:**
- Blue-Chips channel (established crypto plays)
- Mid-Caps channel (emerging opportunities)
- Low-Caps channel (moonshot potential)
- Yield Hub (airdrop farming, 4-5 fig payouts)
- Live Sessions (Dan's real-time analysis)

**Daily routine:**
- Read all new messages (12+ unread Yield Hub, 49+ Live Sessions)
- Extract tickers mentioned 3+ times
- Note conviction signals (🔥 reactions, Dan's endorsements)
- Track price at mention, update 7d/30d/90d

**Output:** Crypto signal database → GREEN signals when multi-source validated

---

### 2. Chart Fanatics (Not Just Riz)
**Access:** ✅ Fully scraped  
**Data to collect:**
- Riz's EURUSD setups (highest conviction)
- Other traders in server (9+ documented methodologies)
- Cross-validate: If multiple traders call same ticker → stronger signal

**Daily routine:**
- Check for new Riz messages
- Scan other traders' channels for setups
- Document entry/stop/target when called
- Track outcomes to validate other traders

**Output:** Not just waiting for Riz - build multi-trader validation

---

### 3. Dumb Money (Social Arbitrage)
**Access:** ✅ 90% scraped  
**Data to collect:**
- High-conviction tickers (20+ 🔥🚀👍 reactions)
- Fresh theses (posted <48h ago, not stale)
- Price at posting, track movement
- Google Trends validation

**Daily routine:**
- Scan new messages for conviction spikes
- Extract tickers with 20+ combined reactions
- Validate with Google Trends (rising search volume?)
- Build conviction doc if validated

**Output:** 2-3 social arb signals per week (not waiting for perfect ones)

---

### 4. DEX Scanner / On-Chain Data
**Tools to integrate:**
- Dexscreener.com (DEX pairs, volume, liquidity)
- Etherscan / BSCScan (whale wallet tracking)
- Token sniffer (scam detection)
- Nansen / Glassnode (if accessible)

**Data to collect:**
- New token launches with liquidity >$100k
- Whale accumulation patterns
- Volume spikes (>10x normal)
- Smart money wallet movements

**Daily routine:**
- Scan Dexscreener for top gainers (filter scams)
- Check if mentioned in Yieldschool (validation)
- Track wallet addresses Dan mentions
- Alert when whales accumulate before pumps

**Output:** On-chain edge (detect smart money before crowd)

---

### 5. Google Trends (Validation Layer)
**Purpose:** Validate social arb + crypto signals  
**Data to collect:**
- Search volume trends for tickers
- Geographic concentration (US vs global)
- Related queries (sentiment)

**Daily routine:**
- Check trends for any ticker with 20+ Discord reactions
- Flag rising trends (not yet peaked)
- Reject if already mainstream (late to party)

**Output:** Filter false signals, confirm early detection

---
