## 🎯 Phase 1 Success Criteria (90 days)

**Deploy Phase 2 ($100k more) IF:**

### 3. Stock Edge Research Plan
**File:** `trading/STOCK-EDGE-RESEARCH.md`

**Identifies gap:** No systematic stock edge yet (beyond social arb)

**Research priorities:**
1. Dividend Aristocrats (value + income)
2. Technical breakouts (pattern-based)
3. Sector rotation (macro-driven)
4. Scan Discord for systematic stock traders

**Timeline:** 30 days to validate 1 stock edge

---

### 4. Paper Trading Log (Updated)

**Now tracks:**
- Bucket-level allocation
- Phased deployment strategy
- Risk per bucket (0.5% to 100% loss tolerance)

---

### 5. Memory Updated
**File:** `MEMORY.md`

**Documented:**
- Phase 1 allocation (40/30/20/10 split)
- Success criteria for Phase 2
- Missing stock edge (researching)

---

## 🔄 Daily Auto-Updates

**I now track:**

- Riz EURUSD setups (40% bucket)
- Social arb signals from Discord (30% bucket)
- Yieldschool crypto research (20% bucket)
- Stock edge research progress (10% bucket)

**Dashboard updated daily:** `trading/dashboard.html`

## 🚨 Key Decisions Made

### ✅ NOT Equal $100k Buckets
**Rejected:** 4x $100k ($400k total) equal allocation  
**Why:** Edge isn't equal, risk profiles differ, capital efficiency varies

### ✅ Risk-Adjusted by Conviction
**Approved:** $100k total, weighted 40/30/20/10  
**Rationale:** Allocate most to highest conviction (Riz 8.5/10, proven track record)

### ✅ Phased Deployment
**Approved:** Prove Phase 1 ($100k) before deploying Phase 2 ($100k more)  
**Why:** Build track record, validate methodology, cut losers early

### ✅ Stock Edge Gap Identified
**Action:** Research systematic stock strategy over next 30 days  
**Options:** Dividend aristocrats, technical breakouts, sector rotation  
**Deadline:** Validate 1 edge before allocating $10k opportunistic to stocks
