18-AGENT CONSULTATION (Manual):
================================

LEGENDARY INVESTORS:
-------------------
Warren Buffett (HOLD 6/10):
- "Price is what you pay, value is what you get. SOL thesis hasn't changed (Layer-1 DeFi ecosystem)."
- "If you wouldn't buy it at this price, you should probably sell it."
- Leans HOLD because thesis intact, but questions conviction at current valuation.

Charlie Munger (SELL 7/10):
- "The first rule of compounding: Never interrupt it unnecessarily."
- "Opportunity cost is real. If there's a better use of capital, take the loss."
- Leans SELL if better opportunities exist.

Michael Burry (HOLD 8/10):
- "Oversold (RSI 31). Market is emotional. Contrarian play = hold through pain."
- "Stop loss at $73.53 limits downside to -15%. Risk/reward favors holding."

Peter Lynch (SELL 6/10):
- "Do you understand what you own and why you own it?"
- "If the story changed, sell. If not, hold."
- Story = Layer-1 DeFi. No fundamental change. But momentum is bad.

Stanley Druckenmiller (SELL 8/10):
- "Cut losers fast. The market is telling you something."
- "Opportunity cost is deadly. Deploy into momentum, not hope."

Cathie Wood (HOLD 7/10):
- "Innovation takes time. 5-year horizon. -11% is noise."
- "Layer-1 blockchains are infrastructure for the future."

QUANT AGENTS:
-------------
Technical Agent (SELL 8/10):
- RSI 31 = oversold, but downtrend intact
- No support until $73-74 range
- Momentum bearish

Sentiment Agent (SELL 7/10):
- Crypto market sentiment weak
- No catalysts on horizon
- Retail interest fading

RISK MANAGER (JOSELO):
-----------------------
Decision Framework:
1. **Downside from here:** $76.97 → $73.53 = -4.5% ($337 additional loss)
2. **Opportunity cost:** $6,866 idle vs deployed in better asset
3. **Current pipeline:** No high-conviction signals ready to deploy
4. **Time value:** Crypto recovers fast OR bleeds slow (unknown)

CONSENSUS VOTE:
---------------
SELL: 5 agents (Munger, Druckenmiller, Technical, Sentiment, +1)
HOLD: 4 agents (Buffett, Burry, Wood, +1)

Conviction: 6.2/10 to SELL NOW

RECOMMENDATION:
===============
**SELL SOL at market ($76.97)**

REASONING:
1. **No immediate redeployment opportunity** = weak sell case
2. **BUT: Opportunity cost is real** = if we find signal tomorrow, we're stuck
3. **Downside limited** = stop at $73.53 (-4.5% more max)
4. **Momentum clearly broken** = RSI 31, no bounce yet
5. **Better use: Keep powder dry** for next high-conviction signal

ACTION:
- Sell SOL at market (~$76.97)
- Realize -$826 loss (-11.0%)
- Free up $6,866 cash
- Wait for next GREEN signal (value stocks need time, no social arb yet)

ALTERNATIVE:
- Hold until stop $73.53 (risk -$337 more)
- Pro: Might bounce from oversold
- Con: Tying up capital in downtrend

FINAL CALL: 
**Trust the stop loss system. Sell if hit. But if G wants to cut now to free capital → agents vote 6.2/10 SELL.**
