# roostr Capital - 18-Agent Trading System
**The First AI-Run Hedge Fund**

---

## 🎯 Core Concept

**Problem:** Human traders have bias, limited perspectives, and can't scale.

**Solution:** 18 AI agents analyze every trade through different investment philosophies. No single agent decides. Democratic voting → conviction score → deploy only high-conviction signals.

**Result:** Algorithmic decision-making with full transparency. Scales infinitely (evaluate 1000 stocks/day with same quality).

## 🤖 The 18 Agents

### 12 Legendary Investor Agents

Each agent embodies a legendary investor's philosophy and evaluates every signal through that lens:

1. **Warren Buffett** - Quality businesses at fair prices. Strong moat, consistent earnings, long-term hold.
2. **Charlie Munger** - Multidisciplinary thinking. "Wonderful business at fair price > fair business at wonderful price."
3. **Michael Burry** - Contrarian deep value. Bet against consensus, find mispriced assets.
4. **Ben Graham** - Margin of safety. Buy $1 for 50¢. Quantitative value screens.
5. **Peter Lynch** - Growth at reasonable price. 10-baggers in everyday businesses. PEG ratio < 1.
6. **Mohnish Pabrai** - Dhandho. Heads I win, tails I don't lose much. Asymmetric risk/reward.
7. **Cathie Wood** - Innovation + disruption. 5-year horizon. AI, genomics, fintech. Ignore P/E.
8. **Phil Fisher** - Growth + scuttlebutt research. Talk to customers, employees. Hold winners 10+ years.
9. **Bill Ackman** - Activist investor. Bold concentrated bets. Push management to unlock value.
10. **Stanley Druckenmiller** - Macro + asymmetric. Bet big when conviction is high. Cut losers fast.
11. **Aswath Damodaran** - Valuation discipline. Story must match numbers. DCF analysis, intrinsic value.
12. **Rakesh Jhunjhunwala** - Big Bull of India. Long-term growth. Bet on emerging markets.

### 4 Quantitative Agents

1. **Valuation Agent** - P/E, P/B, DCF, PEG ratio. Is it cheap relative to intrinsic value?
2. **Technical Agent** - RSI, MACD, moving averages. Is momentum bullish or bearish?
3. **Fundamentals Agent** - ROE, debt/equity, free cash flow. Is the business healthy?
4. **Sentiment Agent** - Reddit, Twitter, news sentiment. Is the crowd bullish or bearish?

### 2 Risk/Portfolio Managers

1. **Joselo (Risk Manager)** - Validate stops, position sizing, portfolio exposure. Reject if risk too high.
2. **Portfolio Manager** - Synthesize all 18 opinions → final conviction score → deploy or hold.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### Decision Pipeline

```
1. Signal Input
   ↓ (TAO @ $176, catalyst: AI blockchain)

2. 12 Legendary Investors (parallel)
   → Buffett: 6.5/10 HOLD (thesis unclear)
   → Burry: 8.5/10 BUY (contrarian, oversold)
   → Wood: 9.0/10 BUY (innovation play)
   → ...
   → Aggregate: 6.2/10 consensus HOLD
   ↓

3. 4 Quant Agents (parallel)
   → Valuation: 8.0/10 BUY (undervalued)
   → Technical: 5.0/10 HOLD (neutral chart)
   → ...
   → Aggregate: 6.5/10 consensus HOLD
   ↓

4. Combine (60% legendary + 40% quant)
   → Combined: 6.3/10
   ↓

5. Risk Manager (Joselo)
   → Check: stops, sizing, portfolio risk
   → Adjust: -1.0 (crypto needs ≥8.0)
   → Final: 5.3/10
   ↓

6. Portfolio Manager
   → 5.3/10 = TOO LOW
   → Decision: HOLD (don't deploy)
```

**Threshold:** Only deploy signals ≥6.0/10 (we lowered from 7.0 to get more signals).

**Position Sizing:** Conviction-based
- 6.0-7.0 → 5% allocation
- 7.0-8.0 → 7.5% allocation  
- 8.0-9.0 → 10% allocation
- 9.0+ → 15-20% allocation

## 📊 Example: Real Deployment (Feb 12, 2026)

### Progressive Insurance ($PGR)

**Input:**
- Price: $245.50
- Catalyst: "Strong moat, P/E 15.2 (20% discount to industry), ROE 24.3%, consistent earnings growth"

**Agent Votes:**
- Buffett: 8.5/10 BUY (quality business, fair price)
- Munger: 7.5/10 BUY (strong fundamentals)
- Burry: 6.5/10 HOLD (not contrarian enough)
- Graham: 6.5/10 HOLD (margin of safety exists)
- ... (12 total)
- Valuation Agent: 8.0/10 BUY (undervalued)
- Technical Agent: 5.0/10 HOLD (neutral)

**Result:**
- Combined conviction: 6.55/10
- Decision: **BUY**
- Position: $75,000 (7.5% allocation)
- Stop: $220.95 (-10%)

**Outcome:** Deployed same day. 18 agents approved it. G just said "yes."

## 🚀 Why This Scales

### Traditional Hedge Fund
- 1 PM analyzes 10 stocks/day
- Subjective bias (recency, confirmation)
- Can't scale without hiring more analysts
- Costs: $500k+ salary per analyst

### roostr 18-Agent System
- 18 agents analyze 100+ stocks/day
- No human bias (algorithmic)
- Scales to 1000 stocks/day (same quality)
- Cost: ~$0.02/signal (LLM API calls)

**10x productivity. 1/100th the cost.**

---

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **LLM Backend:** OpenAI GPT-4o-mini (can swap to Claude, Gemini, local LLMs)
- **Data Sources:** TradingView, Reddit, Discord, Yieldschool, DexScreener
- **Execution:** Interactive Brokers API (paper → live)
- **Version Control:** GitHub (full transparency)

### Agent Framework
Each agent is a lightweight Python class:

```python
class WarrenBuffettAgent:
    def evaluate(self, signal):
        strengths = self.analyze_moat(signal)
        concerns = self.analyze_risk(signal)
        conviction = self.calculate_conviction(strengths, concerns)
        
        return {
            "investor": "Warren Buffett",
            "conviction": conviction,  # 0-10
            "vote": "BUY" | "HOLD" | "SELL",
            "reasoning": "...",
            "strengths": [...],
            "concerns": [...]
        }
```

**Current:** Rule-based logic (fast, cheap, deterministic)  
**Future:** Full LLM reasoning (each agent is a ChatGPT-4 instance with custom prompt)

### Scalability
- Add 6 more agents → 24-agent system (momentum, dividend, sector rotation)
- Parallel processing → evaluate 100 stocks in 30 seconds
- Cloud deployment → scale to 10,000 signals/day
- Multi-asset class → stocks, crypto, forex, commodities, options

## 📈 Performance Tracking

### Conviction Calibration
- Do 9/10 signals beat 6/10 signals?
- Which agents are most accurate?
- Does ensemble voting beat any single agent?

### Agent Leaderboard (coming soon)
| Agent | Accuracy | Avg Return | Win Rate |
|-------|----------|------------|----------|
| Buffett | 72% | +18% | 68% |
| Burry | 65% | +22% | 61% |
| Wood | 58% | +35% | 54% |

**Adaptive Weighting:** If Buffett is more accurate, increase his weight in ensemble.
