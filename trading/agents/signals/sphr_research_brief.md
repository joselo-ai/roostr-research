## Valuation Adjustments (Premium/Discount)

### Arguments for Premium Valuation:
1. **First-mover advantage** - Unique immersive venue concept, no direct competitor
2. **Accelerating growth** - 15% Q3 YoY vs 5.6% industry avg
3. **Scarcity value** - Only one venue operational (Las Vegas), limited supply
4. **Global expansion optionality** - International Sphere venues = massive TAM
5. **High-margin advertising** - Exosphere monetization (low marginal cost)

### Arguments for Discount:
1. **Single-asset risk** - 100% revenue dependent on one Las Vegas venue
2. **Event-driven revenue** - Lumpy, dependent on artist residencies
3. **Unproven scalability** - Global expansion plan not yet validated
4. **High capex** - Building new Sphere venues = $2B+ per location
5. **Execution risk** - Technology/operational complexity

3. **Wood:** Is this a disruptive innovation in live entertainment?
4. **Damodaran:** What's the DCF value at 10% WACC with 3-5 global venues?
5. **Graham:** What's the margin of safety at current valuation?
6. **Lynch:** Is this a 10-bagger growth story at reasonable price?
7. **Pabrai:** Heads I win (expansion works), tails I don't lose much (Las Vegas cash flow)?
8. **Druckenmiller:** What's the asymmetric bet size given risk/reward?

## Risk Factors

3. **Execution risk** - Global expansion unproven
4. **Capex intensity** - $2B+ per venue limits scale speed
5. **Macro sensitivity** - Consumer discretionary spending downturn
6. **Technology risk** - Immersive tech becomes commoditized

---

## Investment Thesis (Pending Agent Deliberation)

**Bull Case:**  
First-mover in immersive entertainment, accelerating growth (15% Q3), global expansion optionality, high-margin advertising, scarcity value.

**Bear Case:**  
Single-asset risk, unproven scalability, capex-intensive, event-driven revenue volatility, execution risk on global rollout.

**Base Case:**  
TBD (agents to decide)

**Next Steps:**
1. Pull current SPHR price + financials
2. Build peer comp table with multiples
3. Run 19-agent deliberation
4. Generate conviction score + position sizing
