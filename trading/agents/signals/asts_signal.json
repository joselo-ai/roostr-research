  "description": "**AST SpaceMobile** - Building space-based cellular broadband network for direct-to-device connectivity.\n\n**The Bull Case:**\n• Massive TAM: Global mobile connectivity via satellites\n• Strategic partnerships: AT&T, Vodafone, Rakuten (~2.8B subscribers)\n• Technology validated with BlueBird test satellite\n• Binary catalyst: FCC approval unlocks commercial operations\n• First-mover advantage in direct-to-standard-phone satellite connectivity\n\n**The Bear Case:**\n• Pre-revenue, cash-burning business model\n• FCC approval carries binary risk (could delay or deny)\n• SpaceX/Starlink competition (much better capitalized)\n• Massive execution risk on building global satellite constellation\n• No moat clarity until network effects emerge\n• Requires significant additional capital\n\n**The Key Question:**\nIs the probability of FCC approval underpriced by the market at $4.20? This is a classic binary catalyst setup with asymmetric payoff potential but significant downside risk if catalyst fails.\n\n**For Value Investors:** Hard pass - no earnings, no moat evidence\n**For Contrarians:** Interesting IF FCC approval probability is >70%\n**For Growth Investors:** Core thesis - disruptive technology with massive TAM\n**For Catalyst Investors:** Perfect setup with clear binary event"
