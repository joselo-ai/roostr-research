## 💡 Bull Case (Why 8.5/10)

✅ **Valuation cheap** - P/E 10.95 vs sector average  
✅ **Strong Q4 earnings** - Beat expectations  
✅ **Buyback expansion** - Returning cash to shareholders  
✅ **Analyst upgrades** - Cantor raised target $316→$319  
✅ **Defensive play** - Insurance outperforms in volatility  
✅ **Low beta (0.52)** - Half as volatile as market  
✅ **Dividend + buyback** - Total shareholder yield attractive  
✅ **Near 52-week high** - Momentum + breakout  

**Analyst consensus:** Overweight/Buy (target $301-330, +0-10% upside)

## 🚩 Bear Case (Why not 10/10)

⚠️ **Limited upside** - Already near analyst targets ($301 avg vs $300 current)  
⚠️ **Earnings not until Apr 16** - 2 month wait  
⚠️ **Insurance sector risk** - Catastrophic losses (hurricanes, wildfires)  
⚠️ **Modest growth** - Mature business, not a rocket ship  

**Key risk:** Major catastrophe could tank earnings; sector rotation out of value
