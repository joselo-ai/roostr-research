## 💰 VALUATION: Cheap vs Quality

**Current:** $100.95  
**Target Price (analyst consensus):** $107.15 (+6%)  
**Fair Value (12x P/E):** ~$128 (+27%)  
**Conservative Target:** $115 (+14% in 6-12 months)  

**Why the Discount?**
1. Insurance sector out of favor (rate cuts feared)
2. Bermuda domicile (tax concerns overblown)
3. Large cap value ignored in AI/tech mania

**Margin of Safety:** 25-30% based on quality metrics
