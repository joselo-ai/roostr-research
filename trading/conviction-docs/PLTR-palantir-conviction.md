**Date:** Feb 9, 2026  
**Current Price:** $135.90  
**Conviction:** 7.5/10 (YELLOW - Wait for pullback)

## 🎯 Investment Thesis

**AI-powered data platform monopoly** - Government + enterprise lock-in

**What they do:**
- Gotham (defense/intelligence)
- Foundry (enterprise data OS)
- Apollo (software delivery)
- AI Platform (LLM integration layer)

**Why it matters:** Once embedded, nearly impossible to rip out. Network effects + switching costs = durable moat.

## 💡 Bull Case (Why 9/10 potential)

✅ **Government monopoly** - Intelligence community lock-in  
✅ **Enterprise expansion** - 45% revenue from commercial (growing fast)  
✅ **AI positioning** - Platform play on LLM adoption  
✅ **Profitability** - 36% margins, $1.26B FCF  
✅ **Insider confidence** - Founders still control (49.99% voting)  
✅ **Returns** - Up 1,535% over 3 years  

**Analyst consensus:** Buy (price target $190.75, +40% upside)

## 🚩 Bear Case (Why 7.5/10 not 10/10)

❌ **Valuation absurd** - P/E 215 vs S&P 500 22x  
❌ **Price/Sales 77x** - Priced for perfection  
❌ **Recent downgrade** - DA Davidson lowered target $215→$180  
❌ **Stock down 7.3%** - Despite strong Q4  
❌ **High beta (1.69)** - Volatile, tech selloff risk  
❌ **Earnings not until May 4** - Long wait for catalyst  

**Key risk:** If AI hype fades or margins compress, multiple will collapse
