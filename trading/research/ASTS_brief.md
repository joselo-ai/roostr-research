# ASTS (AST SpaceMobile) Research Brief
**Date:** 2026-02-14
**Ticker:** ASTS
**Price:** $4.20
**Market Cap:** ~$1.1B (estimated)

## Company Overview
AST SpaceMobile is building a space-based cellular broadband network that enables standard mobile phones to connect directly to satellites. The company aims to provide mobile connectivity anywhere on Earth.

## Business Model
- Building constellation of "BlueB bird" satellites
- Direct-to-device cellular service (no special phone needed)
- Partnerships: AT&T, Vodafone, Rakuten (covering ~2.8B subscribers)
- Revenue model: Wholesale to mobile carriers

## Key Catalyst (Q1 2026)
**FCC Approval Expected** - Regulatory approval for commercial operations
- Binary catalyst: approval = major unlock, denial = thesis break
- Has already demonstrated technology with test satellites
- Industry trend favorable (Starlink, other competitors validate market)

## Fundamentals
- **Stage:** Pre-revenue (infrastructure build-out)
- **Cash burn:** Significant (building satellite constellation)
- **Balance sheet:** Raised ~$200M+ recently, has capital runway
- **Technology risk:** Proven concept with BlueBird test satellite
- **Competition:** SpaceX (Starlink D2D), Apple (emergency SOS)

## Bull Case
1. FCC approval unlocks commercial operations
2. Massive TAM: global mobile connectivity
3. Strategic partnerships de-risk go-to-market
4. First-mover advantage in direct-to-device space cellular
5. Technology already demonstrated (not vaporware)

## Bear Case
1. Pre-revenue, cash-burning business
2. FCC approval binary risk (could delay or deny)
3. SpaceX competition (better capitalized)
4. Execution risk: building global constellation is capital-intensive
5. No moat if technology commoditizes

## Valuation Context
- Trading on potential, not earnings
- Comparable: early-stage space tech companies
- Current price reflects skepticism about FCC approval timing

## Investment Thesis Decision Points
**For Value Investors (Buffett, Graham):** Hard pass - no earnings, no moat clarity
**For Contrarians (Burry):** Interesting IF FCC approval is underpriced
**For Growth (Cathie Wood):** Core thesis - disruptive technology with massive TAM
**For Catalyst Investors (Ackman):** Perfect setup IF FCC approval is credible

## Recommendation Framework
- **IF** FCC approval is 70%+ likely → Asymmetric opportunity
- **IF** FCC approval is 50/50 → Options-like bet, size accordingly
- **IF** can't assess FCC probability → Pass (unknowable binary)
