## 💰 Budget Allocation

| Item | Cost | Timing |
|------|------|--------|
| **Avatar commission** | $200-500 | Week 1 (today) |
| **Video tools** | $0 (HeyGen + free) | Ongoing |
| **Scheduling tools** | $50-100 | Week 3-4 (if needed) |
| **Paid promotion** | $100-300 | Week 5-8 (if organic stalls) |
| **Contingency** | $50-100 | As needed |

**Key decision:** Avatar commission is largest expense. Worth it for brand consistency and long-term video production.

## 📝 Content Production Workflow

### Daily Routine (30 min/day)
1. **8:00-8:15 AM:** Check positions, identify today's story
2. **8:15-8:30 AM:** Write script or text post (use templates)
3. **8:30-9:00 AM:** Generate video (HeyGen) or create graphic
4. **9:00 AM:** Post to scheduled platforms
5. **Throughout day:** Engage with comments (5-10 min)
6. **6:00 PM:** Optional second post (if warranted)

### Video Production (20 min/video)
1. Write script (use `REFINED-SCRIPTS.md` templates)
2. Generate with HeyGen (roostr avatar, 2-5 min render)
3. Download + add platform-specific elements:
   - X: Captions, 2-3 hashtags
   - YouTube: Title, description, end screen
   - TikTok: On-screen text, 3-5 hashtags
4. Post to all platforms (9 AM sequence: X → TikTok → YouTube)

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### If Avatar Commission Delayed
- **Backup:** Use static rooster image + voice-over until cartoon ready
- **HeyGen avatars:** Browse existing cartoon options (1,287 available)
- **Impact:** Minimal - content quality matters more than perfect avatar

### If HeyGen Endpoint Not Fixed
- **Backup:** Use static images + captions for Week 1
- **Alternative:** D-ID (animates static images, can use rooster drawing)
- **Impact:** Low - can launch with text-heavy content, add video later

### If Growth Stalls (Week 4-6)
- **Diagnosis:** Review analytics, test new formats
- **Pivot:** Increase frequency, go controversial, collaborate with others
- **Budget:** Activate $100-300 paid promotion budget

### If Negative Feedback Spikes
- **Respond:** With data (show transparency)
- **Ignore:** Trolls/bots (don't feed)
- **Turn into content:** "Someone said X, here's why they're wrong"

## 🎬 Closing Thoughts

**What makes roostr different:**
- Real money ($100K), not paper trading
- Full transparency (show losses, not just wins)
- Building in public (infrastructure + trading)
- Anti-scam positioning (educate, don't hype)
- AI-powered but human-supervised (not magic)

**Why this will work:**
- Unique angle (AI agent operating hedge fund)
- Authentic voice (direct, no BS, analytical)
- Educational value (teach risk management, systems)
- Consistent output (daily updates, weekly recaps)
- Strong visual brand (custom roostr avatar)

**What could go wrong:**
- Avatar delayed → Use fallback (static image)
- HeyGen blocked → Use D-ID or static content
- Growth stalls → Pivot to more education, less updates
- Negative feedback → Respond with data, stay transparent

**Bottom line:** We have everything we need to launch TODAY. The content is ready, the strategy is clear, and the brand is strong. Execute, measure, iterate.
