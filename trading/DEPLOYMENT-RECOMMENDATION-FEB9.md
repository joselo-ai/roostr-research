### 2. PLTR - Palantir (YELLOW 7.5/10) ⏸️

**Allocation:** 5% ($5,000) when triggered  
**Stop:** $115 (-15%)  
**Target:** $190 (+40%)

**Why NOT deploy now:**

**Monitor for:**
- Price drops to $110-130

## Deployment Plan

### Phase 1: TRV Entry (Tomorrow)

**Execute:**
1. Market order: Buy $5,000 TRV at open (~$300)
2. Set stop-loss: $276 (-8%)
3. Target: $330 (+10%)
4. Update signals database: Status=GREEN, Deployed=YES

**Expected position:**
- ~16.7 shares @ $300
- Entry: $300.31
- Stop: $276.00
- Target 1: $330.00

### Phase 2: Portfolio After TRV

**Positions (3 total):**
- TAO: $10,000 (40% of deployed)
- SOL: $7,500 (30% of deployed)
- TRV: $5,000 (20% of deployed)
- **Total:** $22,500 (22.5% portfolio)

**Diversification:**
- Crypto: 70% ($17,500)
- Value/Insurance: 20% ($5,000)
- Cash: 77.5% ($77,500)

**Risk profile:**
- High volatility: TAO, SOL (beta >1.5)
- Low volatility: TRV (beta 0.52)
- **Net effect:** Slight reduction in portfolio volatility

## Alternative Scenarios

### Scenario A: Deploy TRV + Wait PLTR
**Allocation:** $5k TRV now, $5k PLTR when $110-120  
**Timeline:** TRV tomorrow, PLTR unknown (could be weeks/months)  
**Risk:** PLTR might never hit $110-120  
**Opportunity cost:** Missing PLTR if it runs to $200+

### Scenario B: Skip TRV, Wait for Better Crypto Entry
**Rationale:** Keep powder dry for TAO/SOL averaging down  
**Risk:** TRV breaks out above $320, miss entry  
**Downside:** Portfolio stays 100% crypto (high volatility)

### Scenario C: Deploy Both (Not Recommended)
**Allocation:** $5k TRV + $5k PLTR at current prices  
**Total:** $27,500 deployed (27.5%)  
**Problem:** PLTR overvalued (P/E 215), violates conviction scoring

---

## Recommendation: Scenario A

**Execute tomorrow:**
1. Deploy $5,000 TRV at market open
2. Set stop $276, target $330
3. Monitor PLTR for pullback to $110-130
4. Keep $77,500 cash for:
   - PLTR entry (if pullback)
   - TAO/SOL averaging down (if opportunity)
   - Other high-conviction signals (EURUSD, EOG, etc.)

**Rationale:**
- TRV is GREEN (8.5/10) + at entry point → deploy now
- PLTR is YELLOW (7.5/10) + overvalued → wait for pullback
- Portfolio needs defensive balance (currently 100% crypto)
- Risk monitor active (stops protected)
- $77.5k cash reserve maintained (flexibility)
