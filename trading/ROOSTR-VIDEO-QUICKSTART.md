## Option 2: Keep HeyGen (Current)

**Best for:** Speed (already working)

- Use Adrian avatar for now
- Add roostr image as thumbnail/branding
- Focus on script quality > character style
- Animated rooster = nice-to-have, not must-have

## Option 3: Runway ML (Also good)

**URL:** https://runwayml.com  
**Free tier:** Limited generations  
**Process:** Upload image → add voice → generate

## Recommendation

**Today:** Use D-ID free tier (5 min setup, perfect lip-sync)  
**Long-term:** D-ID API integration (after validating it works)

**The rooster you made is perfect.** Just need to make it talk, which D-ID does best.

## Scripts Ready

All in `BETTER-SCRIPT.md` and `REFINED-SCRIPTS.md`:
- Anti-scam angle (60 sec)
- Daily updates (30-45 sec)  
- System announcements (30 sec)
- Weekly recaps (60 sec)

Once D-ID works, we can automate the whole pipeline.
