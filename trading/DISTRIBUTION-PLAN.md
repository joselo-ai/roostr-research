## TikTok Strategy

### Profile Setup
**Username:** @roostrcapital  
**Display Name:** roostr | AI Hedge Fund  
**Bio:**
```
AI trading a $100K hedge fund 📈
Building in public. Real P&L. No BS.
Daily updates 👇
```
**Link:** roostr-research.joselo-ai.dev  
**Profile Video:** 6-second loop of roostr avatar + dashboard

### Content Strategy

**Style:**
- Fast-paced (2.5-3 words/second)
- Punchy edits (cut out pauses)
- On-screen text (captions + emphasis words)
- Trending audio (when appropriate, but voice-first)

**Video Format:**
- Length: 30-45 seconds (sweet spot for completion rate)
- Vertical (9:16 aspect ratio)
- High contrast visuals (charts, dashboards)
- roostr avatar (consistent branding)

### Content Types
1. **Daily updates** (40%) - Quick position reviews
2. **System stories** (30%) - "We built X in Y minutes"
3. **Lessons learned** (20%) - Trading insights, mistakes
4. **Anti-scam** (10%) - Call out BS in AI trading space

### Posting Schedule
- **9:00 AM EST** - Daily (best engagement time)
- 1 video/day, 7 days/week (consistency > volume)

### Hashtag Strategy
**Use 3-5 per video, mix trending + niche:**

**Niche (always include 2-3):**
- #AITrading
- #StockMarket (even for crypto - broader reach)
- #TradingTips
- #InvestingForBeginners

**Trending (rotate based on FYP):**
- #LearnOnTikTok
- #MoneyTok
- #SideHustle (relatability angle)
- #TechTok

**Check TikTok creative center weekly for trending finance hashtags**

### Algorithm Optimization

**First 3 seconds critical:**
- Hook MUST stop scroll
- On-screen text (3-5 words, large font)
- Dynamic visual (chart moving, avatar appearing)

**Completion rate (primary metric):**
- Keep under 45 seconds
- No filler, all value
- End with payoff (lesson, number, insight)

**Engagement signals:**
- Ask question in last 2 seconds ("What would you do here?")
- Controversial takes (invite comments/duets)
- Respond to ALL comments in first hour

### Growth Tactics

**Week 1-2: Seed Content**
- Post consistently (7 videos)
- Test hooks (track which stop scroll)
- Engage with finance/trading creators (thoughtful comments)

**Week 3-4: Iteration**
- Double down on best-performing video types
- Use TikTok analytics (watch time, traffic sources)
- Create "Part 2" for high-performing videos

**Week 5-8: Momentum**
- Participate in trending sounds (when relevant)
- Stitch/duet with AI trading scams (call them out)
- Go live (once 1000 followers - show dashboard, Q&A)

**Week 9-12: Scale**
- Post 2x/day if engagement warrants
- Collaborate with other finance creators
- Run "challenges" (best trading question gets video answer)

### Content Ideas (TikTok-Specific)

1. **"AI Trading Bot" parody** - Mock scammy ads, show reality
2. **"Stop loss saved me"** - Before/after chart, dramatic music
3. **"Things hedge funds do (that you should too)"** - Educational series
4. **"Reacting to my own losses"** - Transparency + relatability
5. **"20-minute TradingView build"** - Sped-up screen recording

## Cross-Platform Content Workflow

### Content Creation (Daily)
1. **Create master video** (HeyGen, 45-60s, horizontal 16:9)
2. **Export variations:**
   - X/Twitter: 16:9 or 1:1 (square)
   - YouTube Shorts: 9:16 (vertical, crop from 16:9)
   - TikTok: 9:16 (vertical, optimized for FYP)
3. **Add platform-specific elements:**
   - X: Captions, hashtags (2-3), link in thread
   - YouTube: Title, description, hashtags, end screen
   - TikTok: On-screen text, captions, hashtags (3-5), trending audio check

### Posting Sequence
**9:00 AM EST:**
1. X/Twitter (primary audience)
2. TikTok (immediate)
3. YouTube Shorts (within 30 min)

**Why this order:**
- X has most engaged audience (traders, builders)
- TikTok algorithm rewards early engagement
- YouTube Shorts less time-sensitive

### Repurposing Content

**High-performing X video →**
- Re-edit for TikTok (add trending audio, on-screen text)
- Expand into YouTube long-form (3-5 min deep dive)
- Turn into text thread (screenshot key moments)

**Viral TikTok →**
- Post on X with "This is blowing up on TikTok" framing
- Create "extended cut" for YouTube
- Engage commenters on all platforms

### Analytics Tracking

**Daily (5 min):**
- Check views, completion rate (TikTok, YouTube)
- Check engagement (likes, comments, shares - all platforms)
- Respond to comments

**Weekly (30 min):**
- Review top 3 performers (what worked?)
- Review bottom 3 (what failed?)
- Adjust content calendar based on data

**Key metrics:**
- **X:** Impressions, engagement rate, profile visits, followers
- **YouTube:** Views, watch time, subscribers, click-through rate
- **TikTok:** Views, completion rate, shares, followers

---

## Crisis Management

### If Growth Stalls (Week 4-6)
**Diagnosis:**
1. Check analytics (what's not working?)
2. Review competitor content (what are they doing differently?)
3. Survey audience (ask what they want to see)

**Pivots to try:**
- Increase video frequency (2x/day on TikTok)
- Change content mix (more education, less updates)
- Test new formats (live streams, collaborations, stitches)
- Go controversial (hot takes, scam callouts)

### If Negative Feedback Spikes
**Response protocol:**
1. Acknowledge with data (show transparency)
2. If valid criticism, commit to change
3. If trolling/bots, ignore (don't feed)
4. Turn into content ("Someone said X, here's why they're wrong")

### If Account Suspension/Shadowban
**Prevention:**
- Avoid spam-like behavior (max 3 hashtags on X, 5 on TikTok)
- Don't buy followers (ever)
- Diversify platforms (don't rely on one)

**Response:**
- Appeal immediately (all platforms have processes)
- Shift focus to other platforms temporarily
- Notify audience via available channels
