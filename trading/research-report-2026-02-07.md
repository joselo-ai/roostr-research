## ✅ SOCIAL ARBITRAGE - Ready to Deploy

### 🟢 GREEN Signal #1: $TAC (TransAlta)
**Conviction:** 8.5/10  
**Community:** 51 high-conviction reactions (32👍 + 19🔥)  
**Thesis:** META datacenter power in Alberta  
**Position Size:** $10-12k  
**Status:** Conviction doc created  
**Next:** Check current price + set entry/stop  

**Why GREEN:**
- Strongest community conviction (51 reactions)
- Clear catalyst (META datacenter)
- Multiple conviction docs = sustained interest
- No counter-signals

**Deploy Timeline:** 24-48h (need price check)

---

### 🟢 GREEN Signal #2: $KTB (Kontoor Brands)
**Conviction:** 8.0/10  
**Community:** 22 reactions + Feb 3 "quiet strength" mention  
**Thesis:** Value play (P/E 10-12) + Helly Hansen growth  
**Position Size:** $10-12k  
**Status:** Conviction doc created  
**Next:** Verify P/E + check chart  

**Why GREEN:**
- Less crowded than $ASTS (better risk/reward)
- Recent quiet move (+10%)
- Tracked by quality contributor (Gordo)
- Value multiple + social arb combo
- "40% undervalued" assessment

**Deploy Timeline:** 24-48h (higher priority - less crowded)

---

### 🟡 YELLOW Signal: $ASTS (AST SpaceMobile)
**Conviction:** 6.8/10 (already documented)  
**Community:** 67 total reactions (most in Dumb Money)  
**Thesis:** Space infrastructure  
**Status:** Full conviction doc exists (17k words)  
**Issue:** **May be crowded** (everyone already in)  

**Decision:** PASS for now (wait for pullback or de-risking)

---

### 🔴 RED Signal: $AS (Amer Sports)
**Community:** 25🔥 originally  
**Status:** **Counter-signal** (France contact says "not doing well in Europe")  
**Decision:** AVOID (on-ground intel contradicts thesis)

---

## 🔍 VALUE INVESTING - In Progress

### Status: Research Phase
**Created:** Screening framework + prospect list  
**Location:** `VALUE-STOCKS-PROSPECTS.md`  

**Approach:**
1. Screen for P/E <15, strong FCF, low debt
2. Focus on: Consumer staples, regional banks, industrial B2B, healthcare services
3. Avoid: Value traps, declining industries, overleveraged

**Timeline:**
- Research Agent: Working parallel (may have findings soon)
- Manual research: Starting now
- Target: 2-3 conviction docs by EOD

**Deploy Target:** $25-35k across 3 stocks within 1 week
