## How It Works

### Paper Trading Flow:
1. Signal emerges from research (Discord, trends, etc.)
2. Build conviction doc, score it
3. **If GREEN (8+/10):** Enter paper trade
4. Document entry, stop, targets in PAPER-TRADING-LOG.md
5. Track position, exit when targets/stop hit
6. Record P&L, lessons learned
7. Update win rate metrics

### Research Accuracy Flow:
1. Publish conviction doc with price at publication
2. Add to RESEARCH-CALLS-TRACKER.md
3. Track price at 7d, 30d, 90d, 1yr marks
4. Measure accuracy vs conviction score
5. Build credibility over time
6. Publish monthly accuracy reports
