# Better Script - roostr Style

## Version 1: Hook-First (Dr. Volatil Style)

```
You know what hedge funds spend six months building?

We did it this morning. While having coffee.

Real-time price data. RSI indicators. Automated alerts. The whole stack.

Most traders are still refreshing CoinGecko like it's 2015.

We're pulling live signals from TradingView. No rate limits. No delays. 
When TAO crosses 160, our server fires a Telegram alert before you can 
blink.

Twenty minutes. That's how long it took.

Why? Because we automated the right things.

While other people are building "AI trading bots" that lose money, 
we're building the infrastructure that actually matters.

Risk monitors with RSI context. Stop-loss alerts that work. Real 
conviction scoring - not backtested fantasy.

And we're doing it all in public. Wins, losses, the whole thing.

This is roostr Capital. We're building a hedge fund the way it 
should be built. Fast. Transparent. No BS.

Follow along. It's going to get interesting.

**Length:** ~150 words  
**Tone:** Confident, slightly cocky, direct  
**Hook:** "Six months vs this morning"

## Version 2: Story-First (Reality Series Style)

```
So here's what happened this morning.

We had a problem. Our price feeds were slow. Rate-limited. Basically useless.

I spent 20 minutes fixing it. Integrated TradingView. Full real-time data.

Now we've got live RSI. Automated alerts. The whole infrastructure 
that hedge funds pay six figures for.

And the best part? It actually works.

When I tell people we're building a hedge fund with AI, they think 
it's some magic black box that predicts the future.

Wrong.

It's about infrastructure. Real-time data. Proper risk management. 
Systems that don't break when volatility hits.

We're down 7% on TAO. RSI says oversold. Do we panic? No.

We check the stops. They're holding. We monitor the signals. 
Nothing's changed. We wait.

That's real trading. Not rocket science. Just discipline and 
good systems.

This is roostr Capital. Building in public. 
Full transparency.

Week one, day three. Let's see where this goes.
```

**Length:** ~165 words  
**Tone:** Conversational, honest, relatable  
**Hook:** "Here's what happened"

## Version 3: Comparison Hook (Competitor Angle)

```
Ever see those "AI trading bot" ads?

"Turn $100 into $10,000 overnight!"

Yeah. Those are scams.

Here's what real AI-powered trading looks like.

Real-time data infrastructure. Not promises.
Risk management that actually protects you. Not dreams.
Conviction scoring based on multiple sources. Not hope.

We integrated TradingView this morning. Full automation. 
Live RSI. Instant alerts.

Took 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, other people are paying thousands for trading bots 
that use ChatGPT to analyze tweets.

We're building the boring stuff that matters. Stop-loss protection. 
Signal validation. Multi-source confirmation.

And we're doing it in public. You can watch. All of it.

Currently down on TAO. Up slightly on SOL. Overall -7% for the week.

No hiding. No cherry-picked wins. Just real positions. Real P&L.

This is roostr Capital.

If you want moon promises, go somewhere else.

If you want to see how a real hedge fund gets built, stick around.

**Length:** ~165 words  
**Tone:** Skeptical, anti-hype, differentiated  
**Hook:** "AI trading bot ads vs reality"

## Recommendation

**Use Version 3** (Comparison Hook)
- Differentiates from scammy AI trading content
- Shows we're serious/disciplined
- Builds trust through transparency
- Natural lead-in to "follow the journey"

**Avatar solution:**
Since HeyGen has no cartoons, either:
1. Commission custom rooster avatar illustration
2. Use D-ID (animates static images - can upload rooster drawing)
3. Use best HeyGen avatar + focus on killer script

**Marketing Agent:** 
Want me to spawn a marketing-focused agent to refine this + create 
content calendar?
