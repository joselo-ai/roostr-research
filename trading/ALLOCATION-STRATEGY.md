# roostr Capital Allocation Strategy
**Date:** Feb 12, 2026  
**Total Capital:** $1,000,000 (Paper Trading)

---

## 🎯 Risk-Adjusted Allocation (By Conviction)

### 40% ($400,000) - Value Investing (Stocks)
**Conviction:** 🟢 GREEN (8.0/10)  
**Edge:** Undervalued quality stocks + margin of safety  
**Track Record:** Buffett, Graham, Munger methodology  
**Risk per Trade:** 2-3%  
**Holding Period:** Months to years  
**Frequency:** Continuous deployment (always opportunities)

**Rationale:** Highest allocation because:
- Always deployable (vs Riz's rare setups)
- Proven long-term methodology
- Quality + value = lower risk than crypto
- Full capital utilization (not sitting idle)

**Capital Deployment:**
- 3-5 quality stocks at a time
- $80-150k per position
- Focus: Strong fundamentals, undervalued, margin of safety
- Sources: Value screeners, earnings reports, insider buying
- Hold through volatility (patient capital)

---

### 30% ($300,000) - Social Arbitrage (Stocks)
**Conviction:** 🟢 GREEN (7.7/10)  
**Edge:** Consumer behavior → earnings lag  
**Track Record:** Camillo 77% annual (2006-2020)  
**Risk per Trade:** 2%  
**Holding Period:** Weeks to months  
**Frequency:** Event-driven (product launches, viral trends)

**Rationale:** Second-highest because:
- Validated by Camillo's track record
- Framework documented (social-arbitrage-framework.md)
- Repeatable signal detection (Discord reactions, Google Trends, social media)
- Stock plays = require full capital (no leverage)

**Capital Deployment:**
- 2-3 positions at a time
- $100-150k per position
- Max 2% risk ($6,000 max loss per trade)
- Examples: $ASTS (when GREEN), Celsius-style plays, bike boom signals

---

### 20% ($200,000) - Crypto Fundamentals
**Conviction:** 🟡 YELLOW (emerging)  
**Edge:** Early fundamental research + airdrop farming  
**Track Record:** Dan's $500→$500k on TAO (1000x)  
**Risk:** High volatility (50%+ swings normal)  
**Holding Period:** Months to years  
**Frequency:** Continuous research, selective deployment

**Rationale:** Smaller allocation because:
- Higher volatility = need risk buffer
- Less proven (one example vs Camillo/Riz's repeated success)
- Emerging edge (still validating methodology)
- Opportunity for 10x+ returns justifies inclusion

**Capital Deployment:**
- Yieldschool research (Blue-Chips, Mid-Caps, Low-Caps)
- Airdrop farming (4-5 fig payout opportunities)
- 3-5 positions max
- Accept 50% drawdowns as normal

---

### 10% ($100,000) - Opportunistic/Research
**Conviction:** 🟡 YELLOW (variable)  
**Edge:** TBD - developing new edges  
**Risk:** Accept total loss  
**Holding Period:** Variable  
**Frequency:** As signals emerge

**Rationale:** Smallest allocation because:
- Experimental / learning budget
- New conviction docs testing
- Stock edge development (currently missing)
- $ASTS-style speculative plays

**Capital Deployment:**
- $ASTS when it goes GREEN (if pullback to $80-95) - up to $50k
- New Discord signal testing - $20-30k positions
- Dividend value plays (when stock edge built)
- Accept this could go to $0

## 🚦 Phased Deployment Plan

### Phase 1: $1M Paper (Current - Feb 2026)
**Goal:** Validate methodology at scale, build 90-day track record

**Success Criteria:**
- Net returns: >20%
- Max drawdown: <15%
- Win rate: >60%
- All buckets tested and validated

**Timeline:** 90 days (ends ~May 2026)

**Outcome triggers:**
- ✅ Success → Deploy real capital (start with $100k real)
- ⚠️ Mixed → Rebalance buckets, continue paper trading
- ❌ Failure → Pause, review methodology, rebuild

---

### Phase 2: Real Capital Deployment (After 90 days)
**Trigger:** Phase 1 shows >20% returns + <15% drawdown on paper

**Deployment:**
- Start with $100k real capital
- Allocate based on bucket performance
- Scale winners, cut underperformers
- Maintain paper trading for research bucket

**Real Capital Allocation Example (if all buckets successful):**
- $40k Value Stocks (40%)
- $30k Social Arb (30%)
- $20k Crypto (20%)
- $10k Opportunistic (10%)

---

### Phase 3: Scale Real Capital (After 6 months real trading)
**Trigger:** Real capital deployment validates paper results

**Strategy:**
- Scale based on actual performance (not theory)
- Cut losers aggressively
- Scale winners proportionally
- Consider adding external capital

---

## 🔍 Missing Edge: STOCK STRATEGY

**Current Gap:** No systematic stock edge beyond social arbitrage

**Research Needed:**
1. Scan Discord for systematic stock traders (dividend, value, sector rotation)
2. Build conviction doc for stock methodology
3. Paper trade 10+ stock trades
4. Validate edge before allocating bucket

**Potential Stock Edges to Explore:**
- **Dividend Aristocrats** - Consistent yield + growth
- **Earnings Plays** - Social arb subset (pre-earnings signals)
- **Sector Rotation** - Macro-driven position shifts
- **Technical Breakouts** - Chart pattern edge

**Once Stock Edge Validated:**
- Could become 5th bucket (10-15% allocation)
- Or integrated into Social Arb bucket (if overlap)

---

## ⚠️ Risk Management Rules

**Portfolio Level:**
- Max 20% in any single position
- Max 40% in any single bucket deployed at once
- Emergency stop: -20% portfolio drawdown = pause all trading

**Position Level:**
- Riz: 0.5-1% risk per trade
- Social Arb: 2% risk per trade  
- Crypto: Accept 50% position drawdowns
- Opportunistic: Accept 100% loss

**Rebalancing:**
- Monthly: Review bucket performance
- Quarterly: Rebalance if any bucket -50% or +100%
- Yearly: Full strategy review
