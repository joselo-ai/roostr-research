## 🎯 Phase 1: $1M Capital Allocation

### **40% ($400,000) - Value Investing (Stocks)**
**Conviction:** 🟢 GREEN (8.0/10)  
**Agent:** Value Agent (deploying this week)  
**Edge:** Undervalued quality stocks + margin of safety  
**Track Record:** Buffett, Graham, Munger methodology  
**Risk per Trade:** 2-3%  
**Position Size:** $25-50k per stock  
**Holding Period:** Months to years  

**Rationale:** Highest allocation because:
- Always deployable (not event-dependent)
- Proven 50+ year methodology
- Quality + value = lower risk profile
- Continuous opportunities in Russell 2000

**Capital Deployment:**
- 8-12 quality stocks at a time
- $25-50k per position
- Criteria: P/E <15, P/B <1.5, ROE >15%, low debt
- Focus: Hidden gems, spinoffs, special situations
- Hold through volatility (patient capital)

**Target Positions (This Week):**
- Value Agent scanning 50+ Russell 2000 stocks daily
- Deploy first 2-3 positions ($75-150k) this week
- Examples: Small cap industrials, regional banks, specialty finance

### **30% ($300,000) - Social Arbitrage (Stocks)**
**Conviction:** 🟢 GREEN (7.7/10)  
**Agent:** Social Arb Agent (DEPLOYED Feb 11)  
**Edge:** Crowd attention → stock movement lag  
**Track Record:** Camillo 77% annual (2006-2020)  
**Risk per Trade:** 2%  
**Position Size:** $30-60k per stock  
**Holding Period:** Weeks to months  

**Rationale:** Second-highest because:
- Validated by Camillo's track record
- Agent scanning Reddit/Discord 24/7
- Repeatable signal detection (engagement metrics)
- Social → fundamental conversion plays

**Capital Deployment:**
- 5-8 positions at a time
- $30-60k per position
- Criteria: Engagement >500, market cap <$5B, catalyst present
- Max 2% risk ($20k max loss per trade)
- Examples: $ASTS (10.0/10 conviction), viral consumer plays

**Current Pipeline:**
- ASTS: 10.0/10 conviction, waiting for pullback or FCC catalyst
- Daily scans finding 5-10 new signals
- First deployment when signal >7/10 + G approval

---

### **20% ($200,000) - Crypto Fundamentals**
**Conviction:** 🟡 YELLOW (Emerging)  
**Agent:** Cathie Wood + Catalyst agents (Week 3)  
**Edge:** AI/DeFi narrative + fundamental strength  
**Track Record:** Dan $500→$500k example  
**Risk per Trade:** 2%  
**Position Size:** $20-40k per token  
**Holding Period:** Weeks to months  

**Rationale:** Smaller allocation due to:

- Requires tighter stops

**Current Positions:**
- TAO: $10k (-16.9%), stop $140.84

**Conviction:** 🟡 YELLOW (Variable)  
**Purpose:** Testing new edges, special situations  
**Risk per Trade:** 1-2%  
**Position Size:** $10-20k

## 🔄 Why $1M vs $100k?

### **Institutional Scale Demonstration:**
- $100k = retail trading
- $1M = small institutional / accredited investor level
- Shows we can handle real capital allocation

### **Position Sizing Flexibility:**
- $100k → $5-10k positions (too small for quality stocks)
- $1M → $25-50k positions (institutional minimum)
- Better diversification (8-12 positions vs 3-5)

### **Fundraising Narrative:**
- "$1M validation phase" sounds more serious
- Absolute dollar returns more impressive ($250k vs $25k)
- Easier to extrapolate to $10M+ scale

### **Agent Capacity:**
- Agents can find 10-15 signals/month
- With $100k, only 3-5 deployments max
- With $1M, can deploy 8-12 positions (better utilization)

**Status:** Phase 1 validation in progress  
**Next Milestone:** Deploy first value positions this week  
**Goal:** 25%+ return, <15% drawdown, >60% win rate over 90 days

**If successful → Scale to $10M+ institutional capital**
