**Line: SEA -4.5 | O/U: 45.5**

---

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED PARLAY (4 LEGS)

**1. Seahawks -4.5** — Elite #1 defense (17.2 PPG) vs Drake Maye who's thrown 8 INTs in 3 playoff games; SEA crushed SF 41-6 and held LAR to 27 in CONF game  

**2. UNDER 45.5 Total Points** — Seahawks #1 defense meets Patriots offense that scored only 10 vs DEN in CONF; both teams strong defensively, expect low-scoring grind  

**3. Drake Maye OVER 0.5 Interceptions (-150 or better)** — Maye has averaged 2.7 INTs/game in playoffs (8 INTs in 3 games); facing #1 defense with Devon Witherspoon and Ernest Jones IV  

**4. Kenneth Walker III OVER 65.5 Rushing Yards** — Backup Zach Charbonnet on IR; Walker is the workhorse (81 rush yds in playoffs, averaging 84.7 yds/gm in last 5 games)

## 🔑 KEY INSIGHTS

**🛡️ Defense Wins Championships**
- Seahawks rank #1 in points allowed (17.2 PPG) vs Patriots #4 (18.8 PPG)
- SEA shut out Minnesota 26-0 in Week 13, crushed SF 41-6 in Divisional round

**🚨 Drake Maye's Interception Problem**
- **8 INTs in 3 playoff games** (vs LAC, HOU, DEN)
- Playoff INT rate: 2.7 per game (season average was much lower)
- Facing Seahawks' ball-hawking secondary: Devon Witherspoon, Ernest Jones IV (14 tackles/2 games)

**🏃 Kenneth Walker III Workhorse Role**
- Backup RB Zach Charbonnet on IR — Walker gets 80%+ of carries
- Playoff stats: 81 rush yards (2 games), 4 TDs
- Last 5 regular season games: 67, 100, 56, 97 yards (avg 84.7 yds/gm)

**📉 Patriots Offensive Struggles in Playoffs**
- CONF Championship: Only 10 points vs Denver (10-7 win)
- Maye's playoff passing: 533 yards, 4 TDs, **8 INTs** over 3 games
- Pats offense relies on Rhamondre Stevenson (119 rush yds in playoffs) but facing elite run defense

**🔥 Seahawks Momentum**
- Last 6 games: 5-1 record (only loss: 21-19 @ LAR in Week 11)

## ⚠️ RISK FACTORS

**What Could Break This Parlay?**

1. **Super Bowl Randomness** — Big game jitters, fluky plays, special teams TDs can swing results
2. **Patriots LB Injuries Play** — If Landry/Spillane sit, Pats defense weakens, but could also mean higher scoring game (hurts UNDER)
3. **Drake Maye "Clicks"** — If he protects the ball for once in playoffs, Pats offense could explode (he's capable of 300+ yard games)
4. **Walker III Game Script** — If Seahawks go up big early, they may rest Walker and kill his rushing prop
5. **Weather/Field Conditions** — Levi's Stadium outdoor; Santa Clara weather typically mild, but any rain/wind could impact passing game

**Injury Concerns:**
- **Seahawks:** Zach Charbonnet (RB) on IR — Actually helps Walker prop
- **Patriots:** Harold Landry III (LB, Questionable), Robert Spillane (LB, Questionable) — Weakens defense if they sit

## 🎲 ALTERNATIVE PLAYS

If you want to adjust the parlay:

**Conservative (3-Leg):** Remove Walker rushing prop, keep SEA -4.5 + UNDER + Maye INT (~+350 odds)

**Aggressive (5-Leg):** Add "Sam Darnold OVER 1.5 Passing TDs" — He's thrown 2+ TDs in both playoff games (~+900 odds)

**Player Props Only:** Drake Maye OVER 0.5 INT + Kenneth Walker OVER 65.5 rush + Sam Darnold OVER 225.5 pass yds (~+500)

---

## 🏁 FINAL TAKE

The Seahawks' elite defense is the story of this game. Drake Maye has been turnover-prone in the playoffs (8 INTs!), and Seattle's ball-hawking secondary will feast. Kenneth Walker III is the clear workhorse with Charbonnet out. Expect a defensive battle with Seattle pulling away in the second half.

**The 4-leg parlay balances value with conviction.** If you want safer odds, drop one leg. If you're feeling bold, add Darnold passing TDs.

**Game Prediction:** Seahawks 27, Patriots 17 (SEA covers -4.5, UNDER hits 45.5, Maye throws 2 INTs, Walker rushes for 78 yards)

🍀 **Good luck, G! Let's cash this parlay!**
