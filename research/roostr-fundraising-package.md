(Full playbook saved in: research/virattt-hedge-fund-playbook.md)

## Key Insights

**Who:** Virat Singh (@virattt), GitHub: github.com/virattt/ai-hedge-fund (45.7k stars)

**What:** Multi-agent AI hedge fund proof of concept (educational, not real trading)

**Core Innovation:** 18 AI agents (12 legendary investors + 4 quant agents + Risk Manager + Portfolio Manager) debate every trade, then synthesize with human oversight

**Workflow:**
```
Input (Tickers, Date Range)
    ↓
[12 Legendary Investor Agents] (parallel analysis)
    ↓
[4 Quantitative Agents] (parallel analysis)
    ↓
[Risk Manager] (validates constraints)
    ↓
[Portfolio Manager] (final decision)
    ↓
Output (Buy/Sell/Hold + reasoning)
```

**Technology:**
- LangChain + LangGraph (agent orchestration)
- Python + Poetry (dependency management)
- OpenAI/Claude/Ollama (LLMs)
- Financial Datasets API (market data)

**Key Takeaways for roostr:**
1. Multi-agent architecture proven (45.7k stars = validated demand)
2. Transparency matters (every agent documents reasoning)
3. Risk management non-negotiable (built into workflow)
4. Can run locally (Ollama = no API costs)
5. Backtesting infrastructure critical (validate strategies historically)

**How We're Using It:**
- Installed virattt's repo: /Users/agentjoselo/.openclaw/workspace/ai-hedge-fund
- Will test on our signals (TAO, SOL, ASTS)
- Compare multi-agent output to our manual analysis
- Build roostr-specific agents (Yieldschool Agent, Dumb Money Agent, Riz Agent)

# KEY MESSAGING

## Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

"roostr Capital is the world's first transparent AI hedge fund. We use 18 AI agents — simulating legendary investors like Buffett, Munger, and Burry — to debate every trade. A human Risk Manager enforces strict stops. Every decision is documented publicly on GitHub. We're building in public, from $100k paper trading to $100M AUM. 2% management + 20% performance, standard hedge fund fees. Join us in proving AI can be transparent, disciplined, and profitable."

---

## Core Value Proposition

**For Investors:**
"The only hedge fund where you can watch every trade, read every conviction document, and understand exactly why we bought or sold."

**For the Market:**
"Proof that AI-powered investing can be transparent, disciplined, and risk-managed — not a black box."

---

## Differentiators (vs Competitors)

1. **Multi-Agent AI** — 18 agents debate every trade (not one black-box AI)
2. **Human Risk Manager** — Joselo enforces stops, no exceptions
3. **Full Transparency** — GitHub repo, Twitter updates, public dashboard
4. **Built in Public** — Watch us build from $100k → $100M AUM
5. **Conviction-Based Sizing** — 10/10 conviction = 20%, 7/10 = 10% (not equal-weight)
6. **Risk-First** — -10% stops per trade, <3.8% max portfolio loss (discipline > profits)

---

## Investment Thesis

"AI will revolutionize trading, but transparency and risk management are non-negotiable. We're building the first fund that proves you can have all three."
