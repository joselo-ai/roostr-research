## SLIDE 2: THE VISION

**Title:** "Build the Edge in Public. Launch the Fund for the Audience."

**Content:**

**Phase 1 (Year 1-2): Media Company**
- Prove our edge publicly through content, tools, community
- Build audience of 280k+ subscribers
- Revenue: $100M/year (subscriptions, tools, sponsorships)

**Phase 2 (Year 2+): Hedge Fund**

- Leverage proven track record (built publicly)
- Revenue: 2/20 fees on $10M+ AUM

**Why This Works:**

## SLIDE 3: THE PROBLEM

**Title:** "The Trading Industry Has a Trust Problem"

**Content:**

**Traditional Hedge Funds:**
- Black boxes (no transparency)
- High fees (2/20 standard)
- No proof until you invest

**Trading Educators:**

- No skin in the game (sell courses, don't trade)
- Fragmented advice (everyone has a "system")

**Retail Traders:**
- Overwhelmed by noise
- No systematic edge
- Emotional decisions

**The Gap:**
No one proves their edge publicly BEFORE asking for capital.
