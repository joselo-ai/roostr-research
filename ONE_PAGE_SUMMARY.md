## 🔥 THE 4 EDGES

### 1️⃣ SOCIAL ARBITRAGE (30% allocation)
**What:** Trade consumer trends 2-8 weeks before Wall Street notices  
**How:** Monitor Google Trends + Reddit + Twitter → Enter stocks with 2+ signal confirmation  
**Expected:** 35-60% annual, 55-65% win rate, 1.8-2.5R avg, Sharpe 1.8-2.3  
**Comparable:** Chris Camillo (77% annual returns)

### 2️⃣ TECHNICAL DISCIPLINE (25% allocation)
**What:** Execute simple patterns with RIGID risk management  
**How:** Identify setup → 2-3% stop loss → 2-3R profit target → NEVER override stop  
**Expected:** 40-80% annual, 45-55% win rate, 2.0-3.5R avg, Sharpe 1.5-2.0  
**Comparable:** Riz/Chart Fanatics ($120k+ annual on EURUSD)

### 3️⃣ CRYPTO FUNDAMENTALS (30% allocation)
**What:** Find 10-100x tokens before institutional adoption  
**How:** Screen <$100M market cap → Novel tech + strong team → 2-5% positions → Scale out 5x/10x/25x/50x  
**Expected:** 80-300% annual, 25-40% win rate, 8-20R avg, Sharpe 1.2-1.8  
**Comparable:** Dan/Yieldschool ($500→$500k on TAO, 1000x)

### 4️⃣ MULTI-SOURCE VALIDATION (15% reserve)
**What:** Confirmation filter requiring 2-3 signals before entry  
**How:** Check Google Trends + Dexscreener + Community conviction (need 2/3 to trade)  
**Expected:** +15-25% win rate improvement, +0.5 Sharpe modifier, -60% trade frequency  
**Why:** Bayesian filtering increases accuracy from 55% → 77%

## ⚠️ RISK MANAGEMENT (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Position Sizing
- Social/Crypto: **2-5% risk per trade**
- Technical: **1-2% risk per trade**
- Max single position: **5% of portfolio**
- Max leverage: **20x (FX only)**

### Circuit Breakers
- ⛔ **Daily loss 4%** → Stop trading 24h
- ⛔ **Portfolio drawdown 25%** → Exit all positions, full review
- ⛔ **Edge drawdown 20%** → Suspend edge, redistribute capital
- ⛔ **Emotional breakdown** → Stop immediately (insomnia, panic, obsessive checking)

### Edge Decay Detection (Weekly)
```
IF Sharpe drops 30% below target for 90 days → WARNING
IF Win rate drops 10% below target for 90 days → WARNING  
IF 2+ warnings active → SUSPEND EDGE
```

## 🎓 KEY PRINCIPLES (When in Doubt)

1. **Discipline > Prediction** — You don't need to be right, you need to be consistent
2. **Process > Outcome** — A losing trade can be a good trade if you followed your rules
3. **Position Sizing = Survival** — Risk 1-2% per trade, ALWAYS
4. **Multi-Source = Quality** — Wait for 2-3 signal confirmation, skip low-conviction trades
5. **Losing Streaks Are Normal** — Even 65% win rate = 35% losers, don't panic
6. **Edge Decay is Real** — Monitor weekly, adapt or suspend
7. **Sharpe > Return** — 30% at Sharpe 2.5 > 100% at Sharpe 0.8
8. **Journal Everything** — If you don't log it, you can't improve it
9. **Capital Preservation > Everything** — You can't trade if you're broke
